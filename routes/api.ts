import { response, route } from '@stacksjs/router'

/**
 * This file is the entry point for your application's API routes.
 * The routes defined here are automatically registered. Last but
 * not least, you may also create any other `routes/*.ts` files.
 *
 * Every route in this file is mounted under `/api`. The prefix comes from
 * the `'api'` key in `app/Routes.ts` and lines up with the path the dev
 * proxy forwards (`/api/*`), so `route.get('/hello', ...)` below answers
 * `GET /api/hello`. Paths at the document root belong in a route file
 * whose registry entry sets `prefix: ''`.
 *
 * Framework routes (auth, dashboard, commerce, CMS, etc.) are loaded
 * automatically from storage/framework/defaults/routes/dashboard.ts.
 * You do NOT need to define them here — only add your own custom routes.
 *
 * @see https://docs.stacksjs.com/routing

// Your custom routes go here. This one answers `GET /api/hello`:
route.get('/hello', () => response.text('hello world'))

// `/coming-soon` is served as an STX view from
// `storage/framework/defaults/resources/views/coming-soon.stx`. The
// view auto-resolves through stx-serve, so no route registration is
// needed here. To activate the holding page across the whole app:
//
//   ./buddy coming-soon [--secret=my-magic-token]
//
// Launch the site with `./buddy launch`. Maintenance mode (503 page,
// distinct cookie + state file) is the separate `./buddy down` /
// `./buddy up` pair.
