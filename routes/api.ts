 * This file is the entry point for your application's API routes.
 * The routes defined here are automatically registered. Last but
 * not least, you may also create any other `routes/*.ts` files.
 *
 * Framework routes (auth, dashboard, commerce, CMS, etc.) are loaded
 * automatically from storage/framework/defaults/routes/dashboard.ts.
 * You do NOT need to define them here — only add your own custom routes.

 * @see https://docs.stacksjs.com/routing

// Your custom routes go here:
route.get('/', () => response.text('hello world'))
route.get('/coming-soon', 'Controllers/ComingSoonController@index')
