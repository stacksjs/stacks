## A2P 10DLC: what your platform should handle

Whatever you pick, confirm your platform handles:

- [ ] Brand and campaign registration with TCR
- [ ] Sample message text aligned with what you actually send
- [ ] Opt-in flow documentation submitted to carriers
- [ ] Trust score visibility (and a path to improve it)
- [ ] Throughput appropriate to your list size and send frequency
- [ ] STOP/HELP keyword handling
- [ ] Quiet hours by recipient time zone
- [ ] Suppression list management
- [ ] Consent record retention with timestamps

All major platforms above handle these. Twilio does the lowest-level work and pushes more responsibility onto you.
