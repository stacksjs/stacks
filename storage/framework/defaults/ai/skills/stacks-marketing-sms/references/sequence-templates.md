# SMS Sequence Templates

Full copy templates with character counts, timing, and segmentation logic for every major SMS flow.

> Character counts shown assume GSM-7 encoding. Emojis force UCS-2 (70 chars/segment instead of 160). All templates use `[Brand]`, `[FirstName]`, and `[short.link]` as substitution tokens.
