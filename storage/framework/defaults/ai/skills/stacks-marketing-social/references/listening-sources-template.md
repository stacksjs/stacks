# Listening Sources - Template

Copy this file to `.agents/listening-sources.md` in your project (or `.claude/listening-sources.md`) and fill in the brackets. Claude reads it when running the [listening workflow](listening.md).

Delete sections you don't use. Keep this short and current - stale sources are worse than no sources.

## Notes for Claude

- When asked for "today's top 10," output in the format defined in [listening.md](listening.md#the-daily-triage-loop)
- For LinkedIn and X, use dev-browser with the persistent session (user is logged in)
- For everything else, use the curl recipes in [listening.md](listening.md#sources--light-tooling-curl-recipes)
- Default lookback: 24h. User can override.
- Always ask before posting - output drafts, user approves and posts manually
