# Marketing Operations Stack - Skills + MCPs per AARRR Stage

This doc maps every marketing-skill and every relevant MCP/API integration to the AARRR stage(s) it primarily serves. It's the source for Section 11 of every plan.

> **Note on scope.** Skills below live in this `marketingskills` repo. A few references point to optional tools from adjacent Claude Code marketplaces (e.g., `vercel:agent-browser`, `compound-engineering:diagram-maker`) - substitute equivalents if not installed. When a plan references a skill or tool that isn't available, fall back to the underlying tactic and call it out in Section 13's open decisions.

## The thesis

A small team + fCMO + agentic tooling = output of a 15-20-person traditional marketing org. The skills + MCPs encode workflows that previously required dedicated headcount per channel.

The plan's Section 11 makes this thesis explicit by:
1. Mapping skills to stages so the founder sees which skills execute which work
2. Mapping MCPs/APIs to stages so the founder sees the tooling layer
3. Naming a concrete operational example that proves the stack works
4. Showing capability unlocks by funding stage (pre-seed → seed → Series A)

## Capability unlocks by funding stage

The plan's Section 11 must include this table (or equivalent), specific to the client's current and projected funding stages.

| Stage | Headcount | Tooling | Channels live |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pre-seed / bootstrapped** | fCMO + founder team | All current tooling + marketing-skills library + MCP layer | Organic only (SEO, content, App Store, founder-led social, events, WOM, ambassador) |
| **Seed close** | + first marketing hire (lifecycle/content owner) | + paid ad accounts (Apple Search Ads, Meta, LinkedIn) + `stacks-marketing-ads` skill activated | + paid acquisition pilot ($5-15K/mo - see `funding-stage-unlocks.md` for canonical tiers) |
| **Seed deployment** | + designer (potentially fractional) | + analytics expansion (Mixpanel / Amplitude if needed) | + paid scaling ($20-50K/mo) + first launches (PH, GA) |
| **Series A** | + performance marketing lead + content lead | + dedicated tooling spend ($2-5K/mo software) + sponsored event budget | + paid scaling ($50-150K/mo) + international consideration + B2B vertical expansion |
| **Series B+** | Full-stack marketing org (10+ people) | + agency partnerships + PR firm | + brand campaigns + acquisitions + sponsorships at category level |

## The concrete-example test

Section 11 of the plan must include at least one concrete operational example that proves the stack thesis. The example should be:
- A specific event (not abstract claim)
- From this client's actual history if possible (most credible)
- Tied to a non-technical person executing via the stack (proves it works without dedicated engineering)

Examples from real engagements:
- *"On the kickoff call, Alex drafted a working Customer.io abandoned-cart flow live, using Customer.io's Claude MCP. Validated that a non-technical founder can ship lifecycle work using the skill pattern independently."*
- *"In two weeks, the team scaled from 0 to 14 ranking keywords using `stacks-marketing-programmatic-seo` against the Ahrefs API + GitHub MCP - no dedicated SEO hire required."*
- *"The first email campaign generated a 24% reply rate after `stacks-marketing-cold-email` skill + GA4 MCP + Stripe MCP gave the team a verified target list of users with high LTV but no recent activity."*

If the client has no such moment in their history yet, frame the example as the *first move* - "Here's the demonstration the team will run in week one to validate the stack:"

## When the stack doesn't apply (yet)

For clients without MCP connections set up, frame Section 11 differently:
- List the skills that DO apply with current tooling
- Name which MCPs would unlock which sections of the plan
- Treat MCP setup as a Q1 priority alongside the bedrock fixes

A plan can't claim the agentic-stack thesis if the stack isn't wired. Be honest about state.
