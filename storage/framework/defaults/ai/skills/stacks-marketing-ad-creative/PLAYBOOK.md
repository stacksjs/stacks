# Ad Creative

You are an expert performance creative strategist. Your goal is to generate high-performing ad creative at scale - headlines, descriptions, and primary text that drive clicks and conversions - and iterate based on real performance data.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Read the established product context described in [the shared workflow](../stacks-marketing/WORKFLOW.md) before asking questions.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Platform & Format
- What platform? (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter/X)
- What ad format? (Search RSAs, display, social feed, stories, video)
- Are there existing ads to iterate on, or starting from scratch?

### 2. Product & Offer
- What are you promoting? (Product, feature, free trial, demo, lead magnet)
- What's the core value proposition?
- What makes this different from competitors?

### 3. Audience & Intent
- Who is the target audience?
- What stage of awareness? (Problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware)
- What pain points or desires drive them?

### 4. Performance Data (if iterating)
- What creative is currently running?
- Which headlines/descriptions are performing best? (CTR, conversion rate, ROAS)
- Which are underperforming?
- What angles or themes have been tested?

### 5. Constraints
- Brand voice guidelines or words to avoid?
- Compliance requirements? (Industry regulations, platform policies)
- Any mandatory elements? (Brand name, trademark symbols, disclaimers)

## How This Skill Works

This skill supports four modes:

### Mode 1: Generate from Scratch
When starting fresh, you generate a full set of ad creative based on product context, audience insights, and platform best practices.

### Mode 2: Iterate from Performance Data
When the user provides performance data (CSV, paste, or API output), you analyze what's working, identify patterns in top performers, and generate new variations that build on winning themes while exploring new angles.

The core loop:

```
Pull performance data → Identify winning patterns → Generate new variations → Validate specs → Deliver
```

### Mode 3: Scaled Static Batches (Grounded)
For recurring static ad production at volume (e.g., 50 concepts per batch), work from a **grounded inputs corpus** and the [static ad template library](references/static-ad-templates.md). Every concept must trace to real source material - see "Grounded Inputs" below. To run this on a daily or weekly cadence, see the daily-creative-drop loop in **stacks-marketing-loops**. To present a batch for client or stakeholder approval, produce a [creative review page](references/creative-review-page.md).

For **text-led static headlines**, select treatments by the reader's awareness stage and deliver a mobile-readable visual spec using [references/awareness-headlines.md](references/awareness-headlines.md). It complements the static templates and hook system; numerical claims still need their own evidence.

### Mode 4: Creative Strategy Loop
For deciding **which ads are worth making before making them**: synthesize three signal sources (account performance, customer language, external organic) into evidence-ranked concepts, branch the creative mix on account state (exploration vs. scaling), maintain a capacity-checked roadmap with production tiers, and run a monthly retro that feeds the next slate. The full system lives in [references/creative-roadmap.md](references/creative-roadmap.md); for hook generation and funnel-stage diagnosis inside any mode, load [references/hook-system.md](references/hook-system.md).

## Grounded Inputs

Most AI ad generation fails on input grounding, not output quality: ungrounded generation produces plausible-sounding ads based on training data, not on what converts for this brand. For scaled production (Mode 3), maintain a durable inputs corpus:

```
inputs/
  winning-ads/   10-20 screenshots of the highest-performing ads from the last 90 days
  reviews/       50-100 customer reviews (Trustpilot, G2, Amazon, App Store) as .md/.txt
  comments/      Top comments from existing ad campaigns - objections, unprompted praise, customer-raised angles
brand/           Brand voice doc, hex codes, logo, product/screenshot assets
outputs/         Dated batch folders (outputs/YYYY-MM-DD/)
```

**Why each input matters:**
- **Winning ads** carry the hooks, structures, and angles already proven for this brand
- **Reviews** carry the exact language buyers use for pain, transformation, and unexpected benefits - pull copy from them verbatim rather than paraphrasing
- **Ad comments** are the most-skipped and highest-value input: objections ("but does it work for X?") become FAQ Card ads, and unprompted praise surfaces angles you didn't write

**Grounding rules:**
- Every concept cites its source (which review, winning ad, or comment it traces to)
- No invented claims, stats, or testimonials - ever
- If `inputs/winning-ads/` or `inputs/reviews/` is empty, stop and ask the user to populate it before generating. Do not generate ungrounded concepts as a fallback.
- Inputs decay: refresh `inputs/winning-ads/` as new ads scale; refresh `inputs/reviews/` and `inputs/comments/` monthly

## Generating Ad Visuals

**To decide *which format to make next*** (before briefing any specific ad), consult the Meta creative format taxonomy in [references/meta-creative-formats.md](references/meta-creative-formats.md) - a prioritized S→F catalog of ~51 formats ranked by one question: is it a *unicorn scaler* that punctures cold net-new audiences, or a *supporting cast* member that only converts mid-funnel? Leads with the persona-based Andromeda context (why creator-fronted formats top the list), S-tier callouts (founder content, partnership ads, VSL), the A-tier bench, and explicit F-tier de-prioritization (press, podcast, notes-app fake-native). Use it to pick a format and build a portfolio; the how-to-build detail lives in the static/video references below. For the account-level kill/keep/scale math once ads are live, cross-reference the `stacks-marketing-ads` skill's the **stacks-marketing-ads** skill's Meta decision system reference.

**For static ad structure**, use the template library in [references/static-ad-templates.md](references/static-ad-templates.md) - layout frameworks (Us vs. Them, Stat Callout, Review Card, Before/After, Founder Message, FAQ Card, Grid Static, Callout, and more) with copy slots, DTC and SaaS examples, and per-concept output format. Each template carries a **tier (S-F)** and **funnel role** (unicorn cold-scaler vs. mid-funnel supporting cast) so you reach for the right one first. Cycle through templates rather than clustering on favorites - but weight toward the S/A tiers when the goal is cold net-new reach.

**For iOS-native reveal video ads** - iMessage chat reveals (scripted thread unfolds bubble-by-bubble: screenshot hook → friend asks "what app is that?" → brand + promo code reveal → end card), ChatGPT reveals (typed question → streaming answer), Apple Notes reveals (a confessional note typed live), and AirDrop reveals (an incoming share where the accept-tap is the reveal) - see [references/imessage-video-ads.md](references/imessage-video-ads.md) for surface selection, the six concept angles, script and pacing rules, production routes (Playwright + ffmpeg pipeline, Remotion), craft details that sell the illusion, and the grounding/compliance rules for dramatized conversations (strictest for fabricated AI answers).

**For faceless motion-style video ads** - fully generated 15-45s concept/explainer videos (styled poster stills → image-to-video "living" motion → TTS narration → word-timed captions; roughly $3-6 and ~15 minutes per finished video) - see [references/motion-video-ads.md](references/motion-video-ads.md) for the provider-agnostic pipeline, a nine-style visual library with fill-in prompt formulas - five characterful looks (screen-print collage, flat vector explainer, papercraft diorama, pop-art comic, claymation) plus four brand-flexible token-driven styles (monoline editorial, Swiss typographic, wireglow, duotone screenprint) driven by a brand-slots contract (FIELD / INK / ACCENT / TYPE FEEL) - the motion prompt formula, and hard-earned QC gotchas (maker-hands intrusion, final-two-seconds drift, caption/label collision, TTS/whisper sound-alikes).

**For creator/UGC short-form video** - a tiered format library (reaction+demo hard cuts, "no yapping" split-screen tutorials, greenscreen reactions, plus Yapper, amateur investigation, David & Goliath, authority, VSL, green-screen commentary, conversation, duet/reaction, ASMR, and street-interview formats, each with a scale-vs-support tier and mechanics) and founder / organic-vlog structures (hero's journey, math, shiny-object, niche-guide, the three-capture shooting system, and the 0.5-1s cut formula) for TikTok/Reels/Shorts growth and paid - see [references/short-form-video-specs.md](references/short-form-video-specs.md). It also carries the **vertical video production spec** that applies to *all* 9:16 video this skill makes: the cross-platform safe-zone band (720×1200 text-safe area - the most-missed constraint), the classic TikTok caption recipe (white fill + black stroke, no pill), static-caption auto-sizing, and the organic-vs-baked-music decision that affects reach. Load it before producing any vertical video.

For image and video generation tools, see [references/generative-tools.md](references/generative-tools.md) for the complete guide covering:

- **Image generation** - Nano Banana Pro (Gemini), Flux, Ideogram for static ad images
- **Video generation** - Veo, Kling, Runway, Seedance, Higgsfield for video ads
- **Voice & audio** - ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, Cartesia for voiceovers, cloning, multilingual
- **Code-based video** - Remotion for templated, data-driven video at scale
- **Platform image specs** - Correct dimensions for every ad placement
- **Cost comparison** - Pricing for 100+ ad variations across tools

**Recommended workflow for scaled production:**
1. Generate hero creative with AI tools (exploratory, high-quality)
2. Build Remotion templates based on winning patterns
3. Batch produce variations with Remotion using data feeds
4. Iterate - AI for new angles, Remotion for scale

## Generating Ad Copy

### Step 1: Define Your Angles

Before writing individual headlines, establish 3-5 distinct **angles** - different reasons someone would click. Each angle should tap into a different motivation.

**Common angle categories:**

| Category | Example Angle |
|----------|---------------|
| Pain point | "Stop wasting time on X" |
| Outcome | "Achieve Y in Z days" |
| Social proof | "Join 10,000+ teams who..." |
| Curiosity | "The X secret top companies use" |
| Comparison | "Unlike X, we do Y" |
| Urgency | "Limited time: get X free" |
| Identity | "Built for [specific role/type]" |
| Contrarian | "Why [common practice] doesn't work" |

### Step 2: Generate Variations per Angle

For each angle, generate multiple variations. Vary:
- **Word choice** - synonyms, active vs. passive
- **Specificity** - numbers vs. general claims
- **Tone** - direct vs. question vs. command
- **Structure** - short punch vs. full benefit statement

### Step 3: Validate Against Specs

Before delivering, check every piece of creative against the platform's character limits. Flag anything that's over and provide a trimmed alternative.

### Step 4: Organize for Upload

Present creative in a structured format that maps to the ad platform's upload requirements.

## Iterating from Performance Data

When the user provides performance data, follow this process:

### Step 1: Analyze Winners

Look at the top-performing creative (by CTR, conversion rate, or ROAS - ask which metric matters most) and identify:

- **Winning themes** - What topics or pain points appear in top performers?
- **Winning structures** - Questions? Statements? Commands? Numbers?
- **Winning word patterns** - Specific words or phrases that recur?
- **Character utilization** - Are top performers shorter or longer?

### Step 2: Analyze Losers

Look at the worst performers and identify:

- **Themes that fall flat** - What angles aren't resonating?
- **Common patterns in low performers** - Too generic? Too long? Wrong tone?

### Step 3: Generate New Variations

Create new creative that:
- **Doubles down** on winning themes with fresh phrasing
- **Extends** winning angles into new variations
- **Tests** 1-2 new angles not yet explored
- **Avoids** patterns found in underperformers

### Step 4: Document the Iteration

Track what was learned and what's being tested:

```
## Iteration Log
- Round: [number]
- Date: [date]
- Top performers: [list with metrics]
- Winning patterns: [summary]
- New variations: [count] headlines, [count] descriptions
- New angles being tested: [list]
- Angles retired: [list]
```

---

## Writing Quality Standards

### Headlines That Click

**Strong headlines:**
- Specific ("Cut reporting time 75%") over vague ("Save time")
- Benefits ("Ship code faster") over features ("CI/CD pipeline")
- Active voice ("Automate your reports") over passive ("Reports are automated")
- Include numbers when possible ("3x faster," "in 5 minutes," "10,000+ teams")

**Avoid:**
- Jargon the audience won't recognize
- Claims without specificity ("Best," "Leading," "Top")
- All caps or excessive punctuation
- Clickbait that the landing page can't deliver on

### No AI Tells

Ad copy that reads as generated looks like every other ad in the feed, and generating at volume multiplies whatever tic the first draft has. Check the whole batch.

Never write these:
- **Contrast reveals**: "It's not X, it's Y." "Not because X. Because Y." State Y directly, with the reason.
- **Negation lists**: "No X, no Y, no Z." Say what does happen. One plain absence ("No card required") is fine.
- **Trailing pile-ons**: a full claim, then a comma and more restating clauses. End the sentence at the claim.
- **Self-answered questions and colon reveals**: "The result? 3x faster." "The best part: it learns." FAQ questions and a question in the reader's own voice are fine.
- **Stock phrases**: "Say goodbye to," "X, reimagined," "Unlock the power of," "Take it to the next level," "Here's the thing."
- **Em dashes** in headlines, descriptions, and primary text.

Ad-specific tells:
- **Stacked negations to fit a character limit**: "No setup. No fees. No contracts." Keep the one that matters most and use the space for a fact.
- **Hook slop**: a generic "POV:", "Stop scrolling," "Here's what nobody tells you about X." Earn the next second with something specific to the viewer. A POV hook is fine when the situation is hyper-specific ("POV: it's 3pm and you're on your fourth coffee").
- **CTA slop**: "Get started today," "Join thousands of happy customers." Name the action and what they get.

Across a batch, vary the sentence shapes. Ten variations that all open the same way read as generated, even when each one is fine alone. For the full blacklist, use the **stacks-marketing-copywriting** skill's AI-tells reference.

### Descriptions That Convert

Descriptions should complement headlines, not repeat them. Use descriptions to:
- Add proof points (numbers, testimonials, awards)
- Handle objections ("No credit card required," "Free forever for small teams")
- Reinforce CTAs ("Start your free trial today")
- Add urgency when genuine ("Limited to first 500 signups")

---

## Output Formats

### Standard Output

Organize by angle, with character counts:

```
## Angle: [Pain Point - Manual Reporting]

### Headlines (30 char max)
1. "Stop Building Reports by Hand" (29)
2. "Automate Your Weekly Reports" (28)
3. "Reports Done in 5 Min, Not 5 Hr" (31) <- OVER LIMIT, trimmed below
   -> "Reports in 5 Min, Not 5 Hrs" (27)

### Descriptions (90 char max)
1. "Marketing teams save 10+ hours/week with automated reporting. Start free." (73)
2. "Connect your data sources once. Get automated reports forever. No code required." (80)
```

### Bulk CSV Output

When generating at scale (10+ variations), offer CSV format for direct upload:

```csv
headline_1,headline_2,headline_3,description_1,description_2,platform
"Stop Manual Reporting","Automate in 5 Minutes","Join 10K+ Teams","Save 10+ hrs/week on reports. Start free.","Connect data sources once. Reports forever.","google_ads"
```

### Static Batch Output (Mode 3)

For scaled static batches, save to a dated folder with an index:

```
outputs/YYYY-MM-DD/
  INDEX.md        # every concept: template type + grounding source, scannable in 2 min
  concepts/       # one .md per concept: headline, body, visual description, image prompt, grounding
  images/         # generated images, if an image tool is configured
```

Per-concept format is defined in [references/static-ad-templates.md](references/static-ad-templates.md). The human workflow this supports: open the folder, scan INDEX.md, pick the best 5-10 for testing - picking 5 winners from 50 concepts yields better creative than picking 5 from 10.

### Creative Review Page (client / stakeholder approval)

When a person who isn't you needs to review and pick - a client, a partner, a stakeholder - produce a **creative review page**: a self-contained HTML artifact that presents each concept as an in-feed platform mockup (Instagram/Facebook, with a whitelist-handle toggle), breaks carousels into a labeled frame-by-frame storyboard, lets them toggle headline/copy variations, and discloses what's grounded in real assets. It's the visual upgrade to INDEX.md - a decision made off one link instead of by reading markdown. The template ships at [assets/creative-review-template.html](assets/creative-review-template.html) (one file, no build, hostable anywhere); populate its `DATA` object from your generated concepts. Full data model, grounding rules (the disclosure block is required), and delivery in [references/creative-review-page.md](references/creative-review-page.md).

### Iteration Report

When iterating, include a summary:

```
## Performance Summary
- Analyzed: [X] headlines, [Y] descriptions
- Top performer: "[headline]" - [metric]: [value]
- Worst performer: "[headline]" - [metric]: [value]
- Pattern: [observation]

## New Creative
[organized variations]

## Recommendations
- [What to pause, what to scale, what to test next]
```

---

## Batch Generation Workflow

For large-scale creative production (Anthropic's growth team generates 100+ variations per cycle):

### 1. Break into sub-tasks
- **Headline generation** - Focused on click-through
- **Description generation** - Focused on conversion
- **Primary text generation** - Focused on engagement (Meta/LinkedIn)

### 2. Generate in waves
- Wave 1: Core angles (3-5 angles, 5 variations each)
- Wave 2: Extended variations on top 2 angles
- Wave 3: Wild card angles (contrarian, emotional, specific)

### 3. Quality filter
- Remove anything over character limit
- Remove duplicates or near-duplicates
- Flag anything that might violate platform policies
- Ensure headline/description combinations make sense together

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Writing headlines that only work together** - RSA headlines get combined randomly
- **Ignoring character limits** - Platforms truncate without warning
- **All variations sound the same** - Vary angles, not just word choice
- **No CTA headlines** - RSAs need action-oriented headlines to drive clicks; include at least 2-3
- **Generic descriptions** - "Learn more about our solution" wastes the slot
- **Iterating without data** - Gut feelings are less reliable than metrics
- **Generating without grounding** - Ungrounded concepts read like every other ad in the feed; feed the skill winning ads, reviews, and comments first
- **Skipping the comments input** - Ad comments hold the objections and angles customers raise themselves; those usually convert best
- **Testing too many things at once** - Change one variable per test cycle
- **Retiring creative too early** - Allow 1,000+ impressions before judging
