# Headless CMS Guide

Reference for choosing, modeling, and implementing a headless CMS for marketing content.

## When to Use This Reference

Use this when selecting a CMS for a new project, designing content models for marketing sites, setting up editorial workflows, or connecting CMS content to programmatic pages.

## Headless vs Traditional CMS

A headless CMS separates content management from presentation. Content is stored in a structured backend and delivered via API to any frontend.

### When Headless Makes Sense

- Multiple frontends consume the same content (web, mobile, email)
- Developers want full control over the frontend stack
- Content needs to be reused across channels
- You're building with a modern framework (Next.js, Remix, Astro)
- Marketing needs structured, reusable content blocks

### When Traditional Works Better

- Small team with no dedicated developers
- Simple blog or brochure site
- WYSIWYG editing is a hard requirement
- Budget is tight and WordPress/Webflow does the job

### Decision Checklist

| Factor | Headless | Traditional |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Multi-channel delivery | Yes | Limited |
| Developer control | Full | Constrained |
| Non-technical editing | Requires setup | Built-in |
| Time to launch | Longer | Faster |
| Content reuse | Native | Manual |
| Hosting flexibility | Any frontend | Platform-dependent |

## Content Modeling for Marketing

### Core Principles

1. **Think in types, not pages.** A "Landing Page" is a content type with fields - not an HTML file. This lets you reuse components across pages.
2. **Separate content from presentation.** Store the headline text, not the styled headline. Presentation belongs in the frontend.
3. **Design for reuse.** If testimonials appear on 5 pages, create a Testimonial type and reference it - don't duplicate.
4. **Keep models flat.** Deeply nested structures are hard to query and maintain. Prefer references over nesting.

### Common Marketing Content Types

| Type | Key Fields | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Landing Page** | title, slug, hero, sections[], seo | Modular sections for flexibility |
| **Blog Post** | title, slug, body, author, category, tags, publishedAt, seo | Rich text or Portable Text body |
| **Case Study** | title, customer, challenge, solution, results, metrics[], logo | Link to related products/features |
| **Testimonial** | quote, author, role, company, avatar, rating | Reference from landing pages |
| **FAQ** | question, answer, category | Group by category for programmatic pages |
| **Author** | name, bio, avatar, social links | Reference from blog posts |
| **CTA Block** | heading, body, buttonText, buttonUrl, variant | Reusable across pages |

### SEO Fields Checklist

Every page-level content type needs:

- `metaTitle` - 50-60 characters
- `metaDescription` - 150-160 characters
- `ogImage` - 1200x630px social preview
- `slug` - URL path segment
- `canonicalUrl` - optional override
- `noIndex` - boolean for excluding from search
- `structuredData` - optional JSON-LD override

## Editorial Workflows

### Draft → Review → Publish Cycle

1. **Draft** - Author creates or edits content
2. **Review** - Editor reviews for accuracy, brand voice, SEO
3. **Approve** - Stakeholder signs off
4. **Schedule** - Set publish date/time
5. **Publish** - Content goes live via API

### Preview APIs

All major headless CMS platforms support draft previews:

- **Sanity**: Real-time preview with `useLiveQuery` or Presentation tool
- **Contentful**: Preview API (`preview.contentful.com`) with separate access token
- **Strapi**: Draft & Publish system with `status=draft` query parameter (v5; replaces v4's `publicationState`)

Set up a preview route in your frontend (e.g., `/api/preview`) that authenticates and renders draft content.

### Roles and Permissions

| Role | Can Create | Can Edit | Can Publish | Can Delete |
|------|:----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| Author | Yes | Own | No | Own drafts |
| Editor | Yes | All | Yes | Drafts |
| Admin | Yes | All | Yes | All |

Exact permission models vary by platform. Sanity uses role-based access. Contentful has space-level roles. Strapi has granular RBAC.

## Platform Comparison

| Feature | Sanity | Contentful | Strapi |
|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| Hosting | Cloud (managed) | Cloud (managed) | Self-hosted or Cloud |
| Query Language | GROQ | REST / GraphQL | REST / GraphQL |
| Free Tier | Generous | Limited | Open source (free) |
| Real-time Collab | Yes (built-in) | Limited | No |
| Best For | Developer flexibility | Enterprise multi-locale | Budget / self-hosted |
| Content Modeling | Schema-as-code | Web UI | Web UI or code |
| Media Handling | Built-in DAM | Built-in | Plugin-based |

### Sanity

**Strengths**: GROQ query language is powerful and flexible. Schema defined in code (version-controlled). Real-time collaborative editing. Portable Text for rich content. Generous free tier.

**Considerations**: Steeper learning curve for non-developers. Studio customization requires React knowledge. Vendor lock-in on GROQ queries.

**Marketing fit**: Best when developers and marketers collaborate closely. Strong for content-heavy sites with complex models.

### Contentful

**Strengths**: Mature enterprise platform. Excellent multi-locale support. Strong ecosystem of integrations. Composable content with Studio. Well-documented APIs.

**Considerations**: Pricing scales with content types and locales. Two separate APIs (Delivery and Management). Rate limits can be tight on lower plans.

**Marketing fit**: Best for enterprises with multi-market content needs. Good when you need established vendor reliability.

### Strapi

**Strengths**: Open source, self-hosted option. Full control over data. No per-seat pricing. Customizable admin panel. Plugin ecosystem. REST by default, GraphQL via plugin.

**Considerations**: Self-hosting means you handle infrastructure. Smaller ecosystem than Sanity/Contentful. V5 migration can be significant from V4.

**Marketing fit**: Best for teams with DevOps capability who want full control and no vendor lock-in. Good for budget-conscious projects.

### Others Worth Knowing

- **Hygraph** - GraphQL-native, strong for federation and multi-source content
- **Keystatic** - Git-based, good for developer-content hybrid workflows
- **Payload** - TypeScript-first, self-hosted, code-configured like Sanity
- **Builder.io** - Visual editor with headless backend, good for non-technical marketers
- **Prismic** - Slice-based content modeling, strong Next.js integration

## Integration with Marketing Skills

### Programmatic SEO

Use CMS as the data source for programmatic pages. Store structured data (FAQs, comparisons, city pages) as content types and generate pages from queries. See **stacks-marketing-programmatic-seo** skill.

### Copywriting

CMS content models enforce consistent structure. Define fields that match your copy frameworks (headline, subheadline, social proof, CTA). See **stacks-marketing-copywriting** skill.

### Site Architecture

URL structure, navigation hierarchy, and internal linking all depend on how content is organized in the CMS. Plan your content model and site architecture together. See **stacks-marketing-site-architecture** skill.

### Email Sequences

Pull CMS content into email templates for consistent messaging across web and email. Case studies, testimonials, and blog posts can feed email nurture sequences. See **stacks-marketing-emails** skill.
