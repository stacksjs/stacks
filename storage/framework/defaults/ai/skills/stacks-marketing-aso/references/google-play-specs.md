## Preview Video

- **Format:** YouTube URL (public or unlisted)

- No ads, no monetization, must be embeddable, not age-restricted
- **Playback:** Can autoplay inline with muted audio for up to 30 seconds, depending on device, user settings, network and placement. A play button appears when autoplay is unavailable.
- **Creative:** Demonstrate actual app use and the main benefit early, with visuals understandable without audio. Do not assume every visitor autoplays or watches the full video.
- **Measurement:** Tap-to-play rates exclude autoplay exposure; use listing experiments and your own conversion data before deciding whether a video is worthwhile.

## Android Vitals - Ranking Thresholds

Apps exceeding these thresholds get **reduced visibility** in search and recommendations.

| Metric                       | Overall Threshold | Per-Device Threshold |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| User-Perceived Crash Rate    | **1.09%**         | 8%                   |
| User-Perceived ANR Rate      | **0.47%**         | 8%                   |
| Excessive Partial Wake Locks | 5%                | N/A                  |

**Consequences:** Reduced search visibility, warning labels on listing, quality alerts to users before install.
**Recovery:** Google checks daily using 28-day rolling average.

## Search Ranking - Official Factors

Google confirms these affect ranking:

1. **Metadata relevance** - Title carries most weight. NLP scans title + short desc + full desc.
2. **App quality** - Android Vitals (crash/ANR rates)
3. **Ratings and reviews** - Star rating + review text. 85% of featured apps have 4.0+
4. **Install volume and velocity** - Total installs + daily/weekly frequency
5. **Engagement and retention** - Session frequency, duration, retention rates
6. **Update frequency** - Regular updates signal active maintenance
7. **Localization** - Regional keyword/visual adaptation. 59% of US apps localize titles.
