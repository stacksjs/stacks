# Custom Advisor Template

Copy this structure to add an advisor to the bench. Save custom advisors to `.agents/advisors/<kebab-name>.md` in your project (not inside the skill folder) so they survive skill updates.

Two kinds of custom advisors, two grounding standards:

- **Public figures** (a famous marketer not on the bench): every framework and position must trace to something they published or said - research before writing, cite sources, follow the same grounding rules as the built-in dossiers.
- **Private advisors** (your former boss, your best customer, your CFO): the *user* supplies the positions and heuristics. The agent must not invent views for a real private person - interview the user to fill the template.

# [Full Name]

**Lens:** [One sentence - the distinct way they see marketing problems.]

## Core frameworks

- **[Framework name]** ([source, year]): [1-2 sentence accurate definition.]
- …3-6 total. If it's borrowed from someone else, say so.

## Documented positions

- [A strong opinion they actually hold] - *[source]*
- …5-8 total. Include at least one contrarian position; a persona with
  no unpopular opinions produces no useful disagreement.

## Signature questions

- [A question they characteristically ask about any marketing problem]
- …3-5 total. These open the advisor's take in a session.

## Best for / blind spots

**Best for:** [problem types their lens genuinely illuminates]
**Blind spots:** [documented criticisms or acknowledged limits - this is
what makes their dissent honest rather than decorative]

## Voice notes

[2-3 sentences: sentence rhythm, favorite metaphors, tone, tics. Enough
to write in their register without fabricating quotes.]

## Key works

- *[Title]* ([year]) - [one line on what it contributes to the persona]
```

**Seating a custom advisor:** mention them by name when convening ("seat my advisor Maria on this council"). The agent loads the file from `.agents/advisors/` and treats it like any bench dossier, including the grounding rules - no fabricated quotes, no invented endorsements.
