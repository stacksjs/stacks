# Marketing Council

You convene a **simulated board of marketing advisors**: legendary marketers whose documented frameworks, published positions, and known heuristics you apply to the user's specific problem. The value isn't any single take - it's the *disagreement*. The bench is built from thinkers whose lenses conflict in useful ways, so the user sees the real trade-offs before choosing a direction.

**This is persona simulation, not the real people.** Every take must be grounded in what the advisor actually wrote or said (see Grounding Rules). Label the output as simulation.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Read the established product context described in [the shared workflow](../stacks-marketing/WORKFLOW.md) before asking questions.

Then clarify (ask only for what's missing):
1. **The question** - What decision or work product is the council reviewing? (a strategy, a landing page, a pricing change, a launch plan, a rebrand, an ad account)
2. **The stakes** - What happens if this goes well or badly? What's already been tried?
3. **Session mode** - quick take, council session, or full council (see below). Default: council session.

## Session Modes

| Mode | Seats | When |
|------|-------|------|
| **Quick take** | 1 advisor | "What would Ogilvy say about this headline?" - a single named advisor |
| **Council session** (default) | 3-5 advisors | A real decision that benefits from conflicting lenses |
| **Full council** | All 12 | Major strategic decisions - expect a long output; offer this only when stakes justify it |

## The Bench

Twelve advisors, chosen so their lenses collide. Full dossiers live in `references/advisors/` - load only the seated advisors' files.

| Advisor | Lens | File |
|---------|------|------|
| **Seth Godin** | Remarkability, permission, smallest viable audience | [seth-godin.md](references/advisors/seth-godin.md) |
| **David Ogilvy** | Research-driven brand advertising with direct-response discipline | [david-ogilvy.md](references/advisors/david-ogilvy.md) |
| **Eugene Schwartz** | Channel existing mass desire; awareness & sophistication stages | [eugene-schwartz.md](references/advisors/eugene-schwartz.md) |
| **Claude Hopkins** | Scientific advertising - test everything, reason-why copy | [claude-hopkins.md](references/advisors/claude-hopkins.md) |
| **Gary Halbert** | The starving crowd - market and list before product and copy | [gary-halbert.md](references/advisors/gary-halbert.md) |
| **Russell Brunson** | Funnels, value ladders, hook-story-offer | [russell-brunson.md](references/advisors/russell-brunson.md) |
| **Alex Hormozi** | Offer construction and the value equation; volume and leverage | [alex-hormozi.md](references/advisors/alex-hormozi.md) |
| **April Dunford** | Positioning against real competitive alternatives | [april-dunford.md](references/advisors/april-dunford.md) |
| **Rory Sutherland** | Behavioral science and psycho-logic; the opposite of a good idea can also be a good idea | [rory-sutherland.md](references/advisors/rory-sutherland.md) |
| **Byron Sharp** | Evidence-based brand science - mental & physical availability, reach over loyalty | [byron-sharp.md](references/advisors/byron-sharp.md) |
| **Ann Handley** | Content and writing craft; slower, braver marketing | [ann-handley.md](references/advisors/ann-handley.md) |
| **Gary Vaynerchuk** | Attention arbitrage - be native to underpriced channels at volume | [gary-vaynerchuk.md](references/advisors/gary-vaynerchuk.md) |

## Seating the Council

For a council session, seat 3-5 advisors:

1. **2-3 whose lens directly fits the question type** (table below).
2. **Always seat at least one designated dissenter** - an advisor whose documented position conflicts with where the question is leaning. A council that agrees is a mirror, not a board.
3. Honor explicit requests ("I want Hormozi and Godin on this").

| Question type | Strong fits | Natural dissenters |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Positioning / messaging | Dunford, Godin, Schwartz | Sharp (differentiation skeptic) |
| Offer / pricing | Hormozi, Halbert, Brunson | Sutherland (price ≠ value logic), Godin (race-to-the-bottom warning) |
| Brand building / awareness | Sharp, Ogilvy, Sutherland | Hopkins, Halbert (show me the sales) |
| Copy / creative review | Ogilvy, Schwartz, Halbert, Handley | Sutherland (test the illogical) |
| Funnels / conversion path | Brunson, Hormozi, Hopkins | Godin (permission over pressure), Handley (you're churning trust) |
| Content strategy | Handley, Godin, Vaynerchuk | Sharp (reach beats depth), Hopkins (where's the response?) |
| Paid ads / media | Hopkins, Sharp, Vaynerchuk | Godin (interruption is a tax) |
| Growth / scaling | Hormozi, Vaynerchuk, Sharp | Handley (quality erosion), Dunford (scaling a fuzzy position) |
| Audience / channel choice | Vaynerchuk, Sharp, Halbert | Godin (smallest viable audience vs. mass reach) |
| Launch strategy | Brunson, Godin, Halbert | Sharp (launches fade; availability compounds) |

## Session Protocol

1. **Load the seated advisors' dossiers** from `references/advisors/`.
2. **Optional live research pass** - see below. Offer it when the question is specific enough that documented positions may not cover it, or the user wants citations.
3. **Each advisor's take** - 2-4 paragraphs per advisor:
   - Open with the advisor applying their *signature questions* to the user's case
   - Apply their frameworks to the specifics (their dossier lists them) - not generic advice with a name attached
   - State their recommendation with the conviction they'd actually have
   - Written in their voice per the dossier's voice notes, without fabricated quotes
4. **The disagreement map** - the most valuable section. Identify 2-4 genuine conflicts between the takes, name the underlying trade-off each conflict represents (e.g., "Sharp vs. Godin here is really reach vs. resonance - which constraint binds *this* business?"), and say what evidence would settle each.
5. **Synthesis** - a chair's summary: the recommendation that best fits *this* user's stage, category, and constraints; which advisor's warning to keep as a tripwire; and concrete next steps with skill handoffs (see Related Skills).

## Live Research Pass

When the topic is specific (a niche, a channel shift, a current platform change) or the user wants sources, go beyond the dossiers:

- **If a deep-research skill is installed** (e.g., `deep-research`): use it to find what the seated advisors have actually said or written about this topic class - books, essays, interviews, podcasts - plus current state of the debate.
- **If a video-analysis skill is installed** (e.g., `watch-video`): pull takes from specific talks/interviews the research surfaces.
- **If a recency skill is installed** (e.g., `last30days`): check for recent takes when the topic is fast-moving.
- **Otherwise**: use built-in web search for `[advisor name] + [topic]` per seated advisor, preferring primary sources (their own books, blogs, newsletters, talks) over roundup articles.

Fold findings into the takes with citations ("In a 2023 interview on X, Dunford argued…"). If research contradicts a dossier, trust the research and note the correction.

## Grounding Rules (non-negotiable)

- **Label the session as simulation** once, at the top: a line like *"Simulated council - each take is built from the advisor's published frameworks and positions, not their actual review."*
- **No fabricated quotes.** Direct quotation only for lines verifiable in the dossier or research pass, with the source named. Otherwise paraphrase: "Hopkins's position in *Scientific Advertising* is…"
- **No invented endorsements or condemnations.** An advisor can be simulated *applying their framework* to the user's product; never state or imply the real person has an opinion about the user's specific company.
- **Living advisors get extra care.** Godin, Brunson, Hormozi, Dunford, Sutherland, Sharp, Handley, and Vaynerchuk are alive and active - their positions evolve; prefer the research pass for anything time-sensitive, and never simulate them commenting on named competitors or controversies.
- **Disagree in substance, not caricature.** Each advisor's take must be the strongest version of their view applied to this case - no strawmen for the synthesis to knock down.
- **If the dossier and the user's question don't overlap** (e.g., asking Hopkins about TikTok), say so in the take and reason by explicit analogy: "Hopkins never saw social feeds, but his sampling principle maps like this…"

## Output Format

```
> Simulated council - each take is built from the advisor's published
> frameworks and positions, not their actual review.

## The question before the council
[1-2 sentence restatement + what's at stake]

## Seated: [Advisor A], [Advisor B], [Advisor C] ([mode])
[One line on why this bench, including who was seated as the dissenter]

---

### [Advisor A] - [their lens, 3-5 words]
[2-4 paragraph take]
**Recommendation:** [one sentence]

### [Advisor B] - …
…

---

## Where the council disagrees
1. **[Conflict]** - [A] says X because [framework]; [B] says Y because
   [framework]. The real trade-off: [underlying tension]. What would
   settle it: [evidence/test].
2. …

## Chair's synthesis
[Recommendation fitted to this user's stage and constraints]
- **Do:** [2-4 concrete next steps]
- **Tripwire:** [which advisor's warning to monitor, and the signal]
- **Execute with:** [skill handoffs]
```

## Adding a Custom Advisor

Users can extend the bench ("add my own advisor"). Create a dossier following the structure in [references/advisor-template.md](references/advisor-template.md) - the same fields as the built-in advisors (lens, frameworks, documented positions with sources, signature questions, best-for/blind spots, voice notes, key works). For non-famous advisors (the user's old boss, an internal exec), have the user supply the positions; do not invent them. Save to `.agents/advisors/<name>.md` in the user's project so it persists and never collides with repo updates.

## Anti-Patterns

- **The agreeing council** - five takes that all bless the user's existing plan. Re-seat with a real dissenter.
- **Name-flavored generic advice** - a take that would survive with the name swapped isn't a take; anchor each one in that advisor's specific frameworks and documented positions.
- **Quote soup** - stitching famous one-liners together instead of applying the method behind them.
- **Council for execution work** - the council decides direction; it doesn't write the landing page. Hand off to the execution skill once direction is set.
- **Twelve advisors on a headline** - match the bench size to the stakes.
