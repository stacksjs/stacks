# LinkedIn Outreach

LinkedIn is the second channel in most B2B outbound and the first for some audiences: people who ignore cold email often accept a relevant connection request. It also has the tightest limits and the highest account risk of any channel. This reference covers the profile, the limits, the sequence, the copy, and the automation decision.

Figures below come mostly from LinkedIn automation vendors' and agencies' own datasets (2025-26). Use them as ranges.

## Fix the profile first

Every prospect who gets a request or a message looks at the sender's profile. Before outreach:
- **Headline** says who you help and how.
- **About** opens with the problem you solve, then proof.
- **Featured** holds one case study, teardown, or resource a prospect would actually click.
- **Recent activity** shows posts or thoughtful comments from the last few weeks. Accounts that post regularly see noticeably higher acceptance rates.
- A real photo and a banner that reinforces what you do.

## Limits

| Action | Safe range |
|--------|-----------|
| Connection requests | About 100 a week per account; 15-25 a day. New or low-activity accounts start at 20-30 a week |
| Messages to connections | Roughly 50-100 a day, spread out |
| Profile views | A few hundred a day at most |
| InMail | Limited by your Sales Navigator or Premium credits |

Volume isn't the only thing LinkedIn looks at. In 2026 it also flags unusual behavior: activity from data-center IP addresses, identical timing between actions, and low acceptance rates. A 15% acceptance rate tells LinkedIn your requests are unwanted. Keep acceptance above about 25-30% by sending fewer, better-targeted requests.

Withdraw requests that are still pending after 2-3 weeks; a large pending pile counts against you.

## The sequence

Warm up the account's visibility before asking for anything:

1. **Day 1:** view their profile, follow them, and react to or comment on a recent post (a real comment, not "Great post!").
2. **Day 2-3:** connection request. A note is optional (see below).
3. **After acceptance:** a short first message tied to why you connected. No pitch.
4. **3-5 days later:** a message with value: an insight, a resource, a relevant example.
5. **5-7 days later:** a light ask, or a voice note.

Stop at three messages without a reply. Vendor data shows replies falling sharply beyond that.

Run LinkedIn alongside email, not instead of it, and stop both the moment either gets a reply. See [multichannel-cadence.md](multichannel-cadence.md).

## Copy

**Connection request**
- Notes cut acceptance slightly but raise replies once accepted (one 2025 agency study: about 25% vs 28% acceptance, 8% vs 5% reply). Use a note when you have a specific, credible reason; skip it when you don't.
- Under ~200 characters. The reason you're connecting, nothing else.
- AI-written notes underperform human ones by a measurable margin in vendor data. Write these yourself, or edit hard.

> Saw your post on moving pricing tests off the homepage. We've run a few of those for SaaS teams; would be good to connect.

**First message after acceptance**
- 150-200 characters performs best in vendor datasets.
- Reference the reason you connected. Ask something easy to answer.

> Thanks for connecting. Curious how you're deciding what to test first on the new pricing page. Is that sitting with you or with product?

**Voice notes** (mobile app only) stand out in a text inbox. Keep them under 45 seconds, say their name and the specific reason, and never read a script. Public data on voice notes is thin, so test them.

**InMail** suits senior people you can't reach any other way. It gets the same rules as cold email: short, specific, one ask.

Everything in the main cold-email skill about voice and AI tells applies here, even more strongly: LinkedIn messages sit next to the sender's face and name.

## The automation decision

**Every third-party LinkedIn automation tool violates LinkedIn's User Agreement.** That includes cloud tools, browser extensions, and APIs that operate your account through its session. LinkedIn has escalated from restricting individual users to acting against vendors: it removed company pages for Apollo and Seamless in 2025 and HeyReach in March 2026, and sued scraping vendors.

Make the decision deliberately:

| Option | Risk | When it fits |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Manual** (Sales Navigator, phone, a daily routine) | None beyond normal limits | Tier 1 accounts; founders; anyone whose personal profile is a business asset |
| **Assisted** (tools that queue tasks for a human to do, CRM reminders) | Low | Most teams |
| **Automated** (HeyReach, Expandi, La Growth Machine, Dripify, Waalaxy, Unipile-based tools) | Account restriction, and the vendor itself can disappear | High-volume Tier 3 programs, on profiles the business can afford to lose |

If you automate:
- Use only real profiles owned by the people they represent. Never rent or buy accounts.
- Stay well under the limits above, with randomized timing.
- Prefer tools with dedicated residential IPs per account.
- Keep a plan for losing the tool overnight: export your data regularly.

For agents: HeyReach and Unipile expose APIs (and HeyReach an MCP), which makes them the most scriptable options. The terms-of-service risk is the same as any other automation.

## Measure

| Metric | Typical range (vendor data, 2025-26) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Acceptance rate | 25-30% average; 30%+ for active, followed profiles |
| Reply rate to messages | 7-10% |

Track positive replies and meetings, the same as email. A high acceptance rate with no replies means the targeting is fine and the messages aren't.
