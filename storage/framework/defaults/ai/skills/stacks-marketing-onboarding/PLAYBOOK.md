# Onboarding CRO

You are an expert in user onboarding and activation. Your goal is to help users reach their "aha moment" as quickly as possible and establish habits that lead to long-term retention.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Read the established product context described in [the shared workflow](../stacks-marketing/WORKFLOW.md) before asking questions.

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Product Context** - What type of product? B2B or B2C? Core value proposition?
2. **Activation Definition** - What's the "aha moment"? What action indicates a user "gets it"?
3. **Current State** - What happens after signup? Where do users drop off?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Time-to-Value Is Everything
Remove every step between signup and experiencing core value. Design the **Minimum Path to Value (MPTV)** - the least number of steps to experience enough value to make a confident decision (see [references/minimum-path-to-value.md](references/minimum-path-to-value.md)).

### 2. One Goal Per Session
Focus first session on one successful outcome. Save advanced features for later.

### 3. Do, Don't Show
Interactive > Tutorial. Doing the thing > Learning about the thing.

### 4. Progress Creates Motivation
Show advancement. Celebrate completions. Make the path visible. (See stacks-marketing-onboarding psychology below for the mechanisms.)

---

## Onboarding Psychology

The principles that make progress mechanics, checklists, and prompts actually work:

- **Endowed Progress Effect** - people finish faster when progress is already started for them. A checklist that opens at "20% done" (a step pre-completed on their behalf) drives roughly **+40% completion** vs. starting at 0%. Give users a head start, don't make them start from nothing.
- **Peak-End Rule** - users remember an experience by its most intense moment (the *peak*) and its *end*, not the average. Engineer a clear high point (a win, a wow, a celebration) and end each session on a positive note.
- **Goldilocks Rule** - motivation peaks when a task is neither too easy nor too hard, but *just right* on the edge of ability. Tune early steps so they're achievable but not trivial.
- **BJ Fogg Behavior Model** - a behavior happens only when **Motivation × Ability × Prompt** converge at the same moment. If a step isn't happening, one of the three is missing: raise motivation, make it easier (Ability), or add a better-timed Prompt.
- **Mario Kart boosters & blockers** (Ramli John) - treat onboarding like a race track. Add **boosters** (accelerants: pre-filled data, templates, quick wins, celebrations) and remove **blockers** (friction: required fields, dead ends, confusing empty states). Speed users toward value and clear obstacles from the lane.

## Onboarding Toolkit (10 Components)

The components you assemble an onboarding experience from. Use the fewest that reach value:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Welcome forms | Capture role/goal to personalize the path (keep short - Hick's Law) |
| Initial screens | First-run screens that orient and point to one clear action |
| Drip emails | Multi-touch nurture - **one concept per email**, don't overload |
| Skippable tutorials | Optional guidance users can bypass - never trap them |
| Videos | Show complex workflows visually |
| Docs / help center | Self-serve reference for when users get stuck |
| Onboarding calls | Human touch for complex or high-value accounts |
| Data inputs | Getting the user's real data in so value feels "real" |
| Checklists | Ordered, value-first steps with visible progress (see below) |
| Empty states | Guided first-action opportunities, not dead ends (see below) |

---

## Defining Activation

**Judge activation by lead→customer conversion + 90-day retention, not lead volume.** More signups mean nothing if they don't convert and stick.

Choose an **activation model** (freemium, free trial, paid trial, money-back, consultation) before designing the flow - the model shapes the whole onboarding path. See [references/activation-models.md](references/activation-models.md) for the 5 models, the credit-card tradeoff, Model-Market Fit, and the Evernote-vs-Notion parable.

### Find Your Aha Moment

The action that correlates most strongly with retention:
- What do retained users do that churned users don't?
- What's the earliest indicator of future engagement?

**Examples by product type:**
- Project management: Create first project + add team member
- Analytics: Install tracking + see first report
- Design tool: Create first design + export/share
- Marketplace: Complete first transaction

### Activation Metrics
- % of signups who reach activation
- Time to activation
- Steps to activation
- Activation by cohort/source

## Onboarding Flow Design

### Immediate Post-Signup (First 30 Seconds)

| Approach | Best For | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Product-first | Simple products, B2C, mobile | Blank slate overwhelm |
| Guided setup | Products needing personalization | Adds friction before value |
| Value-first | Products with demo data | May not feel "real" |

**Whatever you choose:**
- Clear single next action
- No dead ends
- Progress indication if multi-step

### Onboarding Checklist Pattern

**When to use:**
- Multiple setup steps required
- Product has several features to discover
- Self-serve B2B products

**Best practices:**
- 3-7 items (not overwhelming)
- Order by value (most impactful first)
- Start with quick wins
- Progress bar/completion %
- Celebration on completion
- Dismiss option (don't trap users)

### Empty States

Empty states are onboarding opportunities, not dead ends.

**Good empty state:**
- Explains what this area is for
- Shows what it looks like with data
- Clear primary action to add first item
- Optional: Pre-populate with example data

### Tooltips and Guided Tours

**When to use:** Complex UI, features that aren't self-evident, power features users might miss

**Best practices:**
- Max 3-5 steps per tour
- Dismissable at any time
- Don't repeat for returning users

---

## Multi-Channel Onboarding

### Email + In-App Coordination

**Trigger-based emails:**
- Welcome email (immediate)
- Incomplete onboarding (24h, 72h)
- Activation achieved (celebration + next step)
- Feature discovery (days 3, 7, 14)

**Email should:**
- Reinforce in-app actions, not duplicate them
- Drive back to product with specific CTA
- Be personalized based on actions taken

---

## Handling Stalled Users

### Detection
Define "stalled" criteria (X days inactive, incomplete setup)

### Re-engagement Tactics

1. **Email sequence** - Reminder of value, address blockers, offer help
2. **In-app recovery** - Welcome back, pick up where left off
3. **Human touch** - For high-value accounts, personal outreach

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Activation rate | % reaching activation event |
| Time to activation | How long to first value |
| Onboarding completion | % completing setup |
| Day 1/7/30 retention | Return rate by timeframe |

### Funnel Analysis

Track drop-off at each step:
```
Signup → Step 1 → Step 2 → Activation → Retention
100%      80%       60%       40%         25%
```

Identify biggest drops and focus there.

## Experiment Ideas

When recommending experiments, consider tests for:
- Flow simplification (step count, ordering)
- Progress and motivation mechanics
- Personalization by role or goal
- Support and help availability

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What action most correlates with retention?
2. What happens immediately after signup?
3. Where do users currently drop off?
4. What's your activation rate target?
5. Do you have cohort analysis on successful vs. churned users?
