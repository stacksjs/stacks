# First-Party Attribution - The Own-Your-Attribution Runbook

How to instrument and stitch attribution yourself when you control the site/app. This is the build track (Pillar B). It's distilled from real production builds and kept tool-agnostic - **PostHog + SavvyCal are the worked example**, but the pattern maps to any product-analytics tool with `identify()`/merge (Segment, Amplitude, GA4 user-id) and any third-party conversion domain with a metadata passthrough + webhook (Calendly, Cal.com, Stripe Checkout, Typeform).

The core method - closing the `identify()` gap so conversions join to anonymous browsing history - is **adapted from Tessa Kriesel's PostHog attribution approach**. Several of the production refinements that make this operate at scale are also hers, credited inline: the full-touch-path capture that feeds the model track (Step 4), the CRM last-mile with source/confidence/basis and a Paid-vs-Organic read (Step 5), the account rollup, and the "expect ~zero until the stitch is verified, with a campaign-window fallback + backfill" window (Cross-subdomain stitching). Credit where due.

## The one idea

First-party attribution joins **anonymous browsing** to the **eventual conversion**:

```
anonymous visitor          identify() at conversion         breakdown
─────────────────          ────────────────────────         ─────────
distinct_id = anon_uuid    identify(email)                  conversion event
$initial_utm_source=...  → merges anon history        →     by $initial_utm_source
$initial_referrer=...      into person(email)               = "where do customers come from"
```

Everything below serves that join. If `identify()` never fires, every customer looks like they appeared from nowhere - that's *the gap*.

## Step 0 - Audit before you build

The most expensive mistake is rebuilding attribution that already works. Many SaaS apps already `identify()` at signup and already carry first-touch on person profiles. **Check the live data first:**

- Do person profiles carry `$initial_utm_source` / `$initial_referring_domain`?
- Does a conversion event (`Signed up`, `Converted to paid`) break down *cleanly* by channel, or is everything "Direct"?
- Is identity keyed by **email** or by an internal **UUID**? (This changes every guard below.)
- Does cross-subdomain stitching work (marketing site → app.yourdomain.com)?

Only instrument the **specific conversions that are genuinely un-joined**. In one real audit the self-serve funnel was already solved end-to-end; the *only* gap was a booking on a third-party domain. Don't touch what works.

## Step 1 - Identify at each real conversion

At every conversion moment, call `identify()` with a stable id, and set person properties:

```js
// Normalize before use as a distinct_id - analytics tools match exact strings,
// so "Corey@x.com" and "corey@x.com" split into two people otherwise.
export function identifyUser(email) {
  const normalized = email.trim().toLowerCase();
  window.posthog?.identify(normalized, { email: normalized });
}
```

With `person_profiles: 'identified_only'`, this is the moment the person is created and their first-touch props are stamped. Fire it on form success, signup, first purchase - any moment you learn who the anonymous visitor actually is.

## Step 2 - Stitch conversions on a domain you don't own

When the conversion completes on a third-party domain (a booking tool, hosted checkout), you can't run your analytics there. Smuggle the anonymous id through the tool's **metadata passthrough**, then merge it back in the **webhook**.

### 2a - Capture-phase link decorator

One document-level listener rewrites every outbound booking link at click time - no per-CTA edits, and it covers plain clicks, keyboard activation, and middle-click (`auxclick`):

```js
// Refresh anonymous metadata on each SavvyCal activation; clear stale IDs.
function decorate(e) {
  const anchor = e.target?.closest?.("a[href]");
  if (!(anchor instanceof HTMLAnchorElement)) return;

  let url;
  try { url = new URL(anchor.href); } catch { return; }
  const host = url.hostname;
  if (host !== "savvycal.com" && !host.endsWith(".savvycal.com")) return;

  const distinctId = getPostHogDistinctId();   // anonymous-only - see guard
  if (distinctId) {
    url.searchParams.set("metadata[ph_distinct_id]", distinctId);
  } else {
    // The same anchor may have been decorated before identify() or reset().
    url.searchParams.delete("metadata[ph_distinct_id]");
  }
  anchor.href = url.toString();
}
document.addEventListener("click", decorate, true);    // capture phase
document.addEventListener("auxclick", decorate, true);
```

An early return when the guard rejects the current ID leaves any previously added metadata on the anchor. Remove that one parameter instead, preserving the booking path, other parameters and fragment. Check both `click` and `auxclick` after an identity change.

For an **inline embed** (e.g. `/demo` with an embedded calendar), pass the same id in the embed's metadata config instead; poll briefly (~2s) for the id on fresh visits, but never block the calendar from rendering.

### 2b - Read the anonymous id safely

The SDK stub queues calls before it loads, so `get_distinct_id()` returns undefined early - fall back to the tool's own cookie:

```js
export function getPostHogDistinctId() {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return null;

  // Prefer the loaded SDK.
  try {
    if (window.posthog?.__loaded) {
      const id = window.posthog.get_distinct_id();
      if (id) return isAnonymousDistinctId(id) ? id : null;
    }
  } catch {}

  // Fall back to PostHog's cookie before the SDK finishes loading.
  try {
    const prefix = `ph_${POSTHOG_API_KEY}_posthog=`;
    const cookie = document.cookie.split(/;\s*/).find(c => c.startsWith(prefix));
    if (!cookie) return null;
    const parsed = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(cookie.slice(prefix.length)));
    return typeof parsed.distinct_id === "string" && isAnonymousDistinctId(parsed.distinct_id)
      ? parsed.distinct_id : null;
  } catch { return null; }
}
```

### 2c - Merge in the webhook

The third-party tool returns your metadata in its `booking.created` (or `checkout.completed`) webhook. Fire an identity merge + a conversion event to your analytics ingestion endpoint:

```js
// Normalize the booking email the same way the app does (Step 1), or the
// booking person will split from the app-side identity for the same user.
const userId = email.trim().toLowerCase();

const events = [];
if (anonId) {
  events.push({
    event: "$identify",
    distinct_id: userId,                                  // the known person
    properties: { $anon_distinct_id: anonId, $set: { email: userId, name } },  // merge the journey
  });
}
events.push({
  event: "discovery_call_booked",
  distinct_id: userId,
  properties: { booking_id, journey_linked: Boolean(anonId) },  // track the fallback rate
});

// Run after the booking's business-critical work; analytics must not fail it.
try {
  const response = await fetch(`${POSTHOG_HOST}/batch/`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ api_key: POSTHOG_API_KEY, batch: events }),
    signal: AbortSignal.timeout(3000),
  });
  // fetch resolves for HTTP errors too; a resolved promise isn't acceptance.
  if (!response.ok) {
    console.warn("Analytics ingestion rejected", { booking_id, status: response.status });
  }
} catch {
  // Timeouts and network errors stay non-fatal. Never log the payload or email.
  console.warn("Analytics ingestion unavailable", { booking_id });
}
```

When no id survives (link bypassed the decorator, e.g. a booking link inside a generated email/PDF), fall back to **email-only capture** with `journey_linked: false`. You still get the conversion; you just don't get the journey for that one.

**First-touch survival caveat (PostHog specifics):** the `$anon_distinct_id` merge carries the anonymous person's *event* history, but with `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` the anonymous visitor may never have had a person profile, so their `$initial_*` first-touch props aren't guaranteed to land on the merged person. Two robust fixes: call `posthog.createPersonProfile()` client-side *before* the visitor navigates off to the third-party domain (so the profile and its `$initial_*` exist to merge into), **or** capture the first-touch values client-side and pass them through the same metadata passthrough, then re-assert them in the webhook with `$set_once` (`$set_once` never overwrites an existing value, so it's safe). Without one of these, you can get the booking joined to the journey's *events* but a blank `$initial_utm_source` on the person - verify on a real booking. ([posthog-js#1524](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/issues/1524).)

## Step 3 - The guardrails (do not skip)

### Anonymity guard - fail closed

Only ever smuggle the *anonymous* id. After `identify()`, the current `distinct_id` becomes the user's email/UUID - leaking that into a third-party URL, or merging on it in the webhook, folds unrelated people together and leaks PII.

**Pick the guard that matches your identity model - the two are not interchangeable.** The `@`-check below is *only* safe when your app identifies by **email**; do not copy it into a UUID-identity app.

```js
// EMAIL-IDENTITY apps only. True only for ids safe to smuggle: reject
// email-shaped values (an identified email) and cap length.
export function isAnonymousDistinctId(id) {
  return id.length > 0 && id.length <= 100 && !id.includes("@");
}
```

**If the app identifies by UUID, not email**, the `@` check is useless - an identified UUID would pass it and leak. Instead test that the current `distinct_id` still equals the `device_id` (calling `identify()` changes `distinct_id` but leaves `device_id`), and **fail closed** when `device_id` is unreadable:

```js
// UUID-identity variant: only anonymous when distinct_id still == device_id.
function isAnonymous(posthog) {
  const did = posthog.get_distinct_id?.();
  const dev = posthog.get_property?.("$device_id");
  if (!did || !dev) return false;   // ambiguous → treat as identified, send nothing
  return did === dev;
}
```

The rule in one line: **when identity is ambiguous, send nothing.** A missing journey is a data gap; a wrong merge is corruption.

### First-touch data quality - the cheapest big win

Redirects overwrite the true first touch, inflating "Direct"/"Referral" and hiding real acquisition. Exclude these from referrer/channel classification (usually a *settings* change in the analytics tool, not code):

- **OAuth / checkout redirects:** `accounts.google.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`, `login.live.com`, `checkout.stripe.com`
- **Self / subdomain referrals:** `yourdomain.com`, `app.yourdomain.com`, `auth.yourdomain.com`
- **Dev/internal traffic:** `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, test accounts

This is the **highest-trust-per-effort** fix in the whole runbook - no deploy, immediate accuracy gain. Do it first.

### Cross-subdomain stitching

Marketing site → app on a subdomain must share **one analytics project** and a **cross-subdomain cookie** (PostHog's `cross_subdomain_cookie` default handles `yourdomain.com` → `app.yourdomain.com`). Verify the journey survives the handoff, or every signup looks like it started at the app.

**Expect near-zero numbers until the stitch is verified in prod - don't panic.** (Production note from Tessa Kriesel.) Before the cross-subdomain stitch is confirmed live, first-party attribution reads *basically nothing* - journeys break at the handoff and everything looks like direct. It flips from ~0 to real numbers the week the stitch actually ships. Two things get you through that window:

- **A campaign-window heuristic fallback.** When a signup has no linked journey, attribute it to the campaign/channel that was live during its signup window - but only when **date + landing page + active UTMs uniquely narrow it to one source**. With overlapping campaigns, evergreen ads, email sends, branded/direct demand, or a shared landing page, the window can't isolate the cause - mark those `unknown` / low-confidence rather than falsely crediting whatever was live. Used narrowly, it's a real signal while the stitch stabilizes and beats a blank; used bluntly, it manufactures false attribution.
- **Backfill only the pre-stitch records that are actually missing a source.** Many pre-stitch signups already have verified or self-reported attribution - **never overwrite a higher-confidence source with the heuristic.** Backfill only the blanks (campaign-window or self-reported), tag them as such, and keep the heuristic-backfilled history visually separate from verified trends so you don't read a cliff on launch day as a real shift.

Mark these fallback-attributed conversions with a lower-confidence `basis` (see Step 5) so you never confuse a heuristic guess with a verified journey.

### Harden the webhook

- Verify the provider's **signature** (`SAVVYCAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` etc.).
- **Validate** the smuggled id (string, ≤100 chars, no `@`) before merging.
- Run the analytics call **after** any business-critical work, bounded by a timeout, **non-fatal** on failure. Check HTTP status and catch timeout/network rejections, as in Step 2c. If delivery needs retry guarantees, enqueue analytics separately with idempotency rather than failing or replaying the booking.
- **Log the booking id, never the email.**

## Step 4 - Report

- **Config check:** many tools default to *last-touch* (PostHog's Marketing Analytics scene does). First-party attribution wants first-touch - build insights on `$initial_*` explicitly, or switch the default.
- **The payoff insight:** conversion event broken down by `$initial_utm_source` / `$initial_referring_domain` - "where does every signup/booking come from."
- **Channel → revenue:** conversion event by channel, joined to revenue/MRR person properties. Note: some tools compute revenue props *at ingest* (person-on-events), so historical events may read 0 - use the persons table for current MRR, or tier by plan.
- **Track your own coverage:** the `journey_linked: false` rate tells you how many conversions bypassed the stitch. Watch it after launch.
- **Store the full touch path, not just `$initial_*`.** (Refinement from Tessa Kriesel.) First-touch alone lets you break conversions down by *first* channel - but it can't run the multi-touch models from the interpretation track (SKILL.md §2: position-based, linear, time-decay). If you also persist the **ordered sequence of touches** per person (channel + timestamp for each, e.g. an events-table query or a `touch_path` array on the person), the build track *feeds* the interpretation track: you can now score the same journey six ways on your own data instead of only reading about the models. This is what makes Pillar A and Pillar B shake hands - capture first-touch to ship, capture the full path to model.

## Step 5 - The last mile: get attribution into the CRM

(This whole step is a production refinement from Tessa Kriesel - it's the thing that turned first-party attribution from a dashboard into an operating signal.)

A channel breakdown living in your analytics tool is a *report*. The thing sales and lifecycle actually act on is **attribution written onto the record in the CRM**, per account. Sync it out:

- **A `source` field, plus `source_confidence` and `source_basis`.** Don't write a bare channel - write the channel *and how you know it*. `basis` is the **evidence type**: `journey_linked` (verified stitch), `self_reported` (survey), or `campaign_window` (the heuristic fallback above). `confidence` is computed from **evidence quality, not just the basis** - a journey_linked touch with clean UTMs is high, the same touch with dirty/missing UTMs is lower, and a *specific* self-report can be high while a vague one is low. Sales treats a high-confidence source very differently from a low-confidence guess - give them both fields or they'll distrust the whole thing.
- **A Paid-vs-Organic read off the medium.**The single most-used cut in practice: mark a touch**`paid`** only from explicit paid mediums (`cpc`, `ppc`, `paid-social`, `display`, `paid`), and classify the rest into a small, configurable taxonomy rather than a blunt "organic" - `owned` (email, push, SMS - though a sponsored newsletter is *paid*), `earned` (organic search/social, referral - but a partner/affiliate referral is closer to paid), `direct` (no medium - unknown, not organic), `unknown`. The fast operational question a rep or nurture flow needs is really **paid vs non-paid** (did this account cost acquisition dollars) - get that boundary right and keep the finer buckets configurable.
- **Roll up to the account, not just the contact** (B2B) - see the account-rollup note below and in `by-business-type.md`.
- **Hand the record off to revops.** Once the source/confidence/basis + paid/organic live on the account, how pipeline and lifecycle *use* them (routing, lead scoring, nurture branching, revenue attribution reporting) is the **stacks-marketing-revops** skill's job. This runbook's job is to get a trustworthy, labeled source onto the record.

**Account rollup (B2B).** One org is several people signing up with mixed work *and* personal emails, so person-level attribution scatters the story across records. Roll each person's source up to the **account** and attribute at the account level - that's where the signal has to land to be useful to a salesperson working the whole buying committee. Match on email domain, **but exclude free-mail domains** (`gmail.com`, `yahoo.com`, `outlook.com`, …) - those can't identify a company, so a domain match would collapse unrelated people into one bogus account. For personal-email signups, fall back to enrichment, your CRM's contact→account link, or manual matching.

## Verification checklist

- Click a booking CTA → URL shows `metadata[<id_param>]=<anon-uuid>`.
- In console: `posthog.identify('test@x.com')` → click again → the param must **NOT** appear (guard works). `posthog.reset()` after.
- Hand-POST a webhook `/batch/` payload → expect `{"status":"Ok"}`, person appears merged.
- Post-ship: first real webhook log shows `journey_linked: true`.
- Confirm first-touch survives cross-subdomain: start on marketing site, sign up in app, check the person carries the original `$initial_utm_source`.

## Adapting to other stacks

| Piece | PostHog (worked example) | Generalizes to |
|---|---|---|
| Anonymous id | `distinct_id` / `$device_id` | Segment `anonymousId`, Amplitude `deviceId`, GA4 client_id |
| Merge call | `$identify` + `$anon_distinct_id` | Segment `identify` (known `userId`, same `anonymousId`) + `alias` where needed; Amplitude `setUserId` on the session that still holds the anonymous `deviceId` (the stitch is deviceId↔userId - Amplitude's Identify API only sets user *properties*, it does not merge); GA4 `user_id` on the same `client_id` |
| Ingestion | `/batch/` | Segment HTTP API, Amplitude HTTP v2, GA4 Measurement Protocol |
| Third-party passthrough | SavvyCal `metadata[...]` | **Calendly:** only standard UTMs (`utm_source`/`medium`/`campaign`/`content`/`term`) plus `salesforce_uuid` - map the anon id into a supported UTM (e.g. `utm_term`), not a free-form `metadata[]` param. Cal.com metadata; Stripe `client_reference_id`/metadata |
| First-touch props | `$initial_*` | Segment/Amplitude first-touch, GA4 first_user_* dimensions |

The shape never changes: **grab the anonymous id → carry it across the boundary → merge on the far side → break the conversion down by first-touch.**
