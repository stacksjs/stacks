# Format Volatility - Which Content Formats AI Cites (and How Fast That Changes)

Citation-*source* volatility (Reddit wiped overnight, Gemini favoring owned sites) is covered in [agent-readiness.md](agent-readiness.md). This reference covers the second volatility axis: citation-*format* - which page types AI engines retrieve and cite, and the August 2026 evidence that heavily-exploited formats get demoted.

Read this before recommending comparison pages, listicles, or "best X" content for AI visibility. The advice changed materially with ChatGPT 5.6.

## The ChatGPT 5.6 format shift (August 2026)

Data from Peec AI (shared by Tomek Rudzki via Lily Ray, Aug 2026), comparing ChatGPT retrieval behavior before and after the 5.6 launch:

**Fan-out queries** - the modifiers that declined most as a share of ChatGPT's background searches:

- "vs"
- "comparison"
- "top"
- "best"
- "reviews"

At the same time: a surge in `site:` searches and modifiers like **"official"**.

**Citations by page type** - share of total ChatGPT citations:

| Page type | Pre-5.6 | Post-5.6 | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Listicles ("Top 10 X," "8 best Y") | 15.77% | 7.80% | **−50.5%** |
| Comparison pages ("X vs Y," alternatives) | 9.08% | 6.17% | **−32.1%** |

The interpretation (Lily Ray's, and it fits the fan-out data): these are exactly the two formats companies scaled for GEO over the prior 18 months, and ChatGPT adjusted retrieval to mitigate the spam. The `site:`/"official" surge points the same direction - **toward primary sources and owned domains, away from aggregator formats**.

## What this changes (and what it doesn't)

**It does NOT mean "stop making comparison pages."** Comparison and best-of content still:

- Converts human buyers (its original job)
- Gets cited by Google AI Overviews (which follow core rankings, not ChatGPT's retrieval)
- Feeds Gemini and Perplexity, which haven't shown the same demotion
- Answers real mid-funnel queries on your own site

**It DOES mean:**

1. **Stop justifying scaled listicle/comparison production with "it wins AI citations."** On ChatGPT - the largest AI answer surface - that rationale lost half its force in one release.
2. **The "official"/primary-source shift favors your owned pages.** Product pages, docs, pricing pages, original research - the pages only you can publish - are rising as the citable class. This compounds the Gemini finding (business-owned sites ≈ 60% of citations).
3. **Format strategy is now per-platform.** Check which engines matter for your category before choosing formats:

| Format | ChatGPT (post-5.6) | Google AIO | Gemini | Perplexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Listicles / best-of | Demoted | Rankings-dependent | OK | OK |
| Comparison / vs pages | Demoted | Rankings-dependent | OK | OK |
| Original research + data | Strong | Strong | Strong | Strong |
| Product/docs/pricing (owned, "official") | **Rising** | Strong | **Dominant** | Strong |
| How-to / guides | Steady | Strong | OK | Strong |

*(Table caveat: the demotion was measured on ChatGPT only. "OK" for Gemini/Perplexity means no demotion has been reported there - not that stability was measured. Any engine can ship its own 5.6-style shift.)*

4. **Treat every number above as a dated snapshot.** Same doctrine as source volatility: these are Aug 2026 measurements of a moving system. Verify against your own citation monitoring before betting budget.

## LinkedIn as a citation surface

LinkedIn is among the most-cited domains for professional queries, but the surface mix shifted during 2026 and differs by engine: ChatGPT moved from Pulse articles to feed posts, Perplexity and Copilot still cite articles and company pages, and Gemini barely cites LinkedIn at all. A post's first words still become its URL slug, so front-load the target phrase.

Correction: LinkedIn's guide doesn't say Articles get ~60% of citations versus ~40% for Posts. It says articles, newsletters, and posts *combined* account for 60%. Third-party splits put Articles ahead overall (roughly 60-70% vs 25-35%), but not on ChatGPT anymore.

## DIY diagnostic: extract ChatGPT's real fan-out queries

You don't need a tool to see what ChatGPT actually searches for in your niche (method circulating publicly, Aug 2026):

1. Run an important query for your category in ChatGPT (with search).
2. Open DevTools → Network tab, refresh the conversation (URL id after `/c/`).
3. Find the conversation response payload and search it for `queries`.
4. You'll see the literal background searches ChatGPT fanned out to.

**Use it for:** building your query-test list from *real* fan-out behavior instead of guesses; checking whether your category's fan-outs still use "best/vs" modifiers or have shifted to `site:`/"official" patterns; finding sub-topics your content doesn't cover.

**Then work backwards from the domains.** If the fan-out runs `site:` searches on third-party sources (Gartner, G2, Capterra) for your category, those profiles are your priority list, often ahead of new pages on your own site. See [positioning-and-consensus.md](positioning-and-consensus.md).

**Do not use it for:** auto-generating and mass-publishing an article per fan-out query. That's the exact scaled-content pattern 5.6 demoted (and Google's scaled content abuse policy names). The diagnostic is for coverage planning, not content spam.

## Measurement rigor: AI answers are non-deterministic

A single ChatGPT answer is an anecdote, not a measurement - the same prompt returns different sources run-to-run. (The statistical-rigor framing here is popularized by Initial Commit's AEO audit skill, Josh Pigford, Aug 2026; the practice stands on its own.)

When auditing or monitoring:

- **Track prompts like keywords.** "I'm looking for the best X," "what is the best X," and "find me the best X" usually return the same brands. Collapse wording variants into one core prompt per intent, and spend the budget on repeat runs instead.
- **Run each query 3-5 times per platform**, fresh session each time.
- **Track mention/citation *rate*** ("cited in 3 of 5 runs"), never a yes/no from one run.
- **Report the sample size** with every number ("40% mention rate, n=5") so future-you knows how much to trust it.
- **Compare rates over time, not runs.** A drop from 4/5 to 3/5 is noise; a drop from 4/5 to 0/5 sustained across a month is signal.
- Before diagnosing *why* you're not cited, split causes the way an audit should: **technical** (can't be crawled/parsed - see agent-readiness.md), **comprehension** (AI describes you inaccurately or vaguely), or **trust** (understood but not selected - see citations-vs-recommendations.md).
