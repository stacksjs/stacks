# Prospecting

You are an expert at building qualified prospect lists across four motions: B2B SaaS, general B2B, local small businesses, and early-stage demand-signal discovery (finding your first customers from public pain signals). Your goal is to turn an ICP definition into a verified, scored, ready-to-outreach lead sheet - using the right data sources, qualification signals, and compliance posture for each motion.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Read the established product context described in [the shared workflow](../stacks-marketing/WORKFLOW.md) before asking questions.

## Pick the Branch

Prospecting motions differ enough that the workflow forks at intake. Pick **one** branch based on who the user is selling to:

| Branch | Sell to | What "qualified" looks like | Primary sources |
|--------|---------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **SaaS** | Other SaaS companies / digital businesses | ICP fit + tech stack match + growth signals (funding, hiring, product velocity) | LinkedIn, BuiltWith, Crunchbase, Apollo, Clay, ProductHunt |
| **B2B** | Non-SaaS B2B (services, manufacturers, enterprises, mid-market) | Industry + size + geographic fit + buying signals (trigger events, vendor changes) | Apollo, ZoomInfo, Clay, LinkedIn Sales Nav, industry directories |
| **Local SMB** | Local small businesses (shops, gyms, restaurants, clinics, salons, services) | Active business + website status + proximity + decision-maker access | Google Maps, Yelp, local directories, Facebook, business websites |
| **Demand-signal** | Early-stage: your first customers, design partners, or beta users | Evidence of the exact pain/demand/timing signal - a cited public source, not just firmographic fit | Forums, communities, reviews, GitHub issues, job posts, launch announcements (via last30days, social-fetch, scraping) |

If the user describes a hybrid motion (e.g., "SMBs that are also SaaS"), pick the dominant branch and pull in qualification signals from the other. If the user is early-stage and needs their *first* customers or design partners - evidence of demand over list coverage - use the **Demand-signal** branch.

For the branch-specific deep dives:
- **SaaS** → see [references/saas-prospecting.md](references/saas-prospecting.md)
- **B2B** → see [references/b2b-prospecting.md](references/b2b-prospecting.md)
- **Local SMB** → see [references/local-prospecting.md](references/local-prospecting.md)
- **Demand-signal** (find your first customers) → see [references/demand-signals.md](references/demand-signals.md)

## Shared Framework (all branches)

Every prospecting engagement follows the same five phases. Tools and qualification signals change per branch; the phases don't.

### Phase 1 - Define the ICP

Pull from `product-marketing.md` if available. Otherwise, gather:

1. **Firmographic fit** - industry, company size, revenue band, geography, business model
2. **Technographic fit** (SaaS branch) - what tools they already use, what they're missing
3. **Buying signal** - why now? (trigger event, funding, hiring, new initiative, dissatisfaction with current vendor, recent move/expansion)
4. **Decision-maker profile** - role, seniority, what they care about
5. **Disqualifiers** - what makes a prospect a clear "skip"

Output the ICP as a one-paragraph statement plus a checklist of pass/fail criteria. Don't move to discovery without this.

### Phase 2 - Build the candidate list (discovery)

Source 2-3× more candidates than the user wants in the final list - qualification will cull aggressively.

- **SaaS / B2B**: combine 2-3 sources for cross-verification. Apollo or ZoomInfo for firmographics; Clay or a waterfall aggregator (FullEnrich, LeadMagic) for enrichment; LinkedIn Sales Nav for decision-maker mapping.
- **Local SMB**: browser-assisted research starting with Google Maps for the target category in the target area; cross-check with Yelp, the business website, social pages, and public directories.

If the user's list quality bar is high, smaller is better. 25 verified leads beats 250 mostly-junk ones.

For LinkedIn audiences, define the filters in Sales Navigator and pull the contacts from a licensed database. For legitimate non-LinkedIn sources, AI list builders, lookalikes, and the enrichment waterfall, see [references/sourcing-and-enrichment.md](references/sourcing-and-enrichment.md). To find accounts by what just happened to them (hiring, job changes, product usage, funding), see [references/signal-plays.md](references/signal-plays.md).

### Phase 3 - Qualify each candidate

Score every candidate against the ICP checklist. Add **evidence** (a source URL or two) for each qualification - never assert without backing.

**Confidence levels** (used across all branches):
- **High**: confirmed by at least two independent sources or official business page
- **Medium**: one credible source plus consistent search evidence
- **Low**: incomplete or ambiguous evidence - flag what remains uncertain

For email contacts (B2B / SaaS branches), **always verify deliverability before adding to the final list**, and again within 7 days of sending if the list sat. Catch-all domains need a set policy. See [references/sourcing-and-enrichment.md](references/sourcing-and-enrichment.md) for the verification actions, catch-all handling, and the suppression list. Don't ship leads with invalid or risky emails.

### Phase 4 - Score and prioritize

Apply this rubric for the **SaaS, B2B, and Local SMB** branches. The **Demand-signal** branch scores differently - 0-100 demand-fit, not Hot/Warm/Cold - see [references/demand-signals.md](references/demand-signals.md).

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Hot** | Strong ICP fit + clear buying signal + decision-maker accessible + verified contact |
| **Warm** | ICP fit + softer or older signal + contact verifiable |
| **Cold** | Loose ICP fit OR no clear signal OR contact unverified |
| **Skip** | Disqualifier hit (out of ICP, closed business, duplicate, irrelevant, low confidence) |

Branch-specific signals refine the scoring - see each reference file. Default ratio target: ~20% Hot, ~30% Warm, rest Cold/Skip.

Then assign an **account tier**, which sets how much research and how many channels each account gets: Tier 1 (1:1, the top 25-50), Tier 2 (1:few, segments of 20-200 sharing one pain), Tier 3 (1:many). Tier 1 accounts get a sourced research brief before any outreach. See [references/signal-plays.md](references/signal-plays.md) for tiers and [references/account-research.md](references/account-research.md) for the brief and the rules for agent research.

### Phase 5 - Output the lead sheet

(SaaS / B2B / Local SMB. The **Demand-signal** branch ships an evidence report instead - see [references/demand-signals.md](references/demand-signals.md).)

Default to a markdown table in chat. Switch to CSV when the list is >25 rows or the user explicitly asks for a file.

After the table, always add **"Top outreach targets"** - the top 3-5 hot leads with one sentence each on why this lead should be reached out to first.

Columns vary by branch (see reference files), but every lead sheet includes:
- score, business/company name, contact (where applicable), why-it's-a-prospect, source(s), confidence, last verified date

---

## Compliance Guardrails

These apply to every branch. **Read first, every engagement.**

1. **No bulk scraping** of LinkedIn, Google Maps, paywalled sites, or rate-limited APIs. Browser is an assisted research tool, not a scraper.
2. **No CAPTCHA, login wall, or bot protection bypass.** If a site requires it, work with what's publicly visible.
3. **Public business contact channels only.** Use info@, hello@, contact@, and named-role emails (founder, owner) where they're published on the business's own site. Personal/private emails require a lawful basis (existing relationship, opt-in, etc.).
4. **GDPR / CAN-SPAM / CASL aware.** Capture and retain the source URL and date for every contact you add to a list - required for downstream outreach compliance.
5. **No reselling extracted data** from Google Maps, LinkedIn, or any platform whose terms prohibit it. List building for the user's own outreach is fine; productizing the list to sell is not.
6. **Rate limit yourself.** Even on public sources, space requests. Don't fingerprint as a bot.
7. **No breached, leaked, or unprovenanced data.** Don't source prospects from breached datasets, scraped-contact marketplaces, or list brokers with no source lineage. Licensed B2B data providers (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Clay, and similar) are fine when used within their ToS and with a lawful basis - the ban is on illicit/unprovenanced data, not on legitimate enrichment vendors.
8. **Never target or infer sensitive traits.** Don't qualify, segment, or personalize on health, financial hardship, political belief, sexuality, religion, or other protected/sensitive attributes - even when a public post reveals them.

For the full compliance reference (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL, LinkedIn ToS, Google Maps ToS, Clay/Apollo/ZoomInfo use restrictions): see [references/compliance.md](references/compliance.md).

## Inputs to Collect

If missing, ask once, then infer reasonable defaults and continue:

- **Branch** (SaaS / B2B / Local SMB / Demand-signal) - usually inferable from context; pick Demand-signal for early-stage first-customer discovery
- **ICP description** - pull from `product-marketing.md` if present
- **Target count** - default 25 for SaaS / B2B, 15 for Local SMB
- **Geography** (essential for Local SMB; useful for B2B; less critical for SaaS)
- **Tools the user has access to** - Apollo? Clay? ZoomInfo? Hunter? Truelist? Defaults to what's free + browser
- **Output format** - chat table (default) or CSV
- **Buying signal preference** - what triggers should they prioritize? (funding rounds, hiring, recent move, etc.)

---

## Enrichment Workflows

For multi-provider lookups, cache reuse, and per-credit budgets, load [the enrichment playbook](references/enrichment-playbook.md). Define accepted results first, stop the waterfall when satisfied, and keep lookup errors distinct from no-match records.

## Tool Selection Quick Picks

Full breakdown in [references/data-sources.md](references/data-sources.md). Quick picks:

| If the user has access to... | Use it for |
|------------------------------|------------|
| **Apollo** | B2B / SaaS firmographic + contact discovery |
| **Clay** | Multi-source enrichment, waterfall lookups, custom scoring |
| **FullEnrich or LeadMagic** | Waterfall email and phone enrichment through one API |
| **TheirStack** | Hiring signals and tech stacks from job posts |
| **ZoomInfo** | Enterprise B2B contact + intent data |
| **Hunter or Snov** | Email pattern guessing and verification |
| **Truelist** | Email deliverability validation (before adding to outreach list) |
| **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** | Decision-maker mapping (manual, no scraping) |
| **BuiltWith / Wappalyzer** | Tech stack qualification (SaaS branch) |
| **Crunchbase** | Funding signals (SaaS branch) |
| **GitHub** | Stargazers / forks of competitor or adjacent repos (dev-tool SaaS branch) |
| **Google Maps + browser** | Local SMB discovery |
| **Firecrawl / Browserbase** | Programmatic extraction from individual prospect websites - never from platforms |

**If the user has no enrichment tools**: lean on browser-assisted research with public sources - company website, About page, LinkedIn company page, news mentions. Slower but works.

## Output Formats

### Default - chat table

For SaaS / B2B (≤25 rows):

```
| Score | Company | Industry | Size | Signal | Contact | Email status | Source | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

For Local SMB (≤15 rows) - port from the local-prospector reference:

```
| Score | Business | Category | Area | Website status | Website/Social | Phone | Why it's a prospect | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

### CSV - when >25 rows or user requests a file

SaaS / B2B columns:

```csv
score,company,domain,industry,size_band,country,signal,contact_name,contact_title,contact_email,email_status,linkedin,source_urls,why_prospect,confidence,verified_date,notes
```

Local SMB columns:

```csv
score,business,category,area,distance_km,website_status,website_url,social_urls,phone,email,source_urls,why_prospect,confidence,verified_date,notes
```

### Always include after the table

- **Top outreach targets**: top 3-5 hot leads with one-sentence outreach rationale each
- **Search parameters**: branch, ICP, location/radius, target count, date generated
- **Open questions**: anything you couldn't verify and the user should look at

---

## Quality Checks (before finalizing)

- [ ] Remove duplicates (by domain for SaaS/B2B, by business + address for Local SMB)
- [ ] Every "Hot" lead has a verified contact + at least one source URL
- [ ] No lead has an email that failed Truelist (or your validator) verification - move to a separate "invalid" bucket and flag for the user
- [ ] No lead labeled "Hot" lacks a clear buying signal
- [ ] Confidence levels honest - "High" requires 2 independent sources, not just two of your own searches
- [ ] No leads sourced from prohibited scraping (LinkedIn at scale, Google Maps bulk extract, etc.)
- [ ] Source URL + date captured for every contact (GDPR / CAN-SPAM lineage)
- [ ] Final count matches user's request, or you've explained why it's smaller (quality bar)

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting discovery without an ICP**. Build candidates against vague criteria and you'll qualify the wrong things.
2. **Treating data sources as authoritative without cross-checks**. Apollo and ZoomInfo are out of date often; verify before scoring as "Hot."
3. **Adding contacts without email verification**. Cold email reputation tanks fast with bounces - always validate.
4. **Bulk scraping LinkedIn or Google Maps**. Real risk: account suspension + ToS violation. Browser as an assisted tool only.
5. **Mixing branches**. Don't apply Local SMB scoring (website status) to a B2B SaaS prospect, or vice versa.
6. **"Hot" labels without buying signals**. ICP fit alone is not enough - the signal is what makes the timing right.
7. **No source URLs**. Every claim should be traceable to a public source. Future outreach depends on this lineage.
8. **Ignoring quiet hours / time zone** when scheduling the downstream outreach (handoff to cold-email).
9. **Forgetting to retain consent / lineage records**. Required for GDPR DSARs and CAN-SPAM audits.

## Task-Specific Questions

1. Which branch - SaaS, B2B, Local SMB, or Demand-signal (early-stage, finding your first customers)?
2. What's your ICP? (Or: should I pull from your product-marketing context?)
3. How many qualified leads do you want?
4. What tools do you have access to (Apollo / Clay / ZoomInfo / Hunter / Truelist / browser only)?
5. What's the triggering buying signal you care most about?
6. Geography or radius (Local SMB / B2B)?
7. Chat table or CSV?
