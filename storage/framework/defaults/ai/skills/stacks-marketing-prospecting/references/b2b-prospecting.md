## ICP Signals That Matter (B2B branch)

### Firmographic signals

- **Industry / vertical** - NAICS or SIC codes if precision matters
- **Company size** - headcount band, revenue band, location count
- **Geography** - relevant for time zones, regulations, on-site requirements
- **Business model** - service vs product vs distribution; B2B vs B2B2C
- **Ownership** - independent, PE-backed, public, family-owned - affects buying motion

### Buying signals

- **Trigger events**: new C-level hire, recent acquisition or divestiture, IPO/funding, opening a new location, recent rebrand, expansion announcement
- **Vendor signals**: posting RFPs publicly, switching costs in last quarterly report, contract renewal windows
- **Operational signals**: recent layoffs (cost pressure) or rapid hiring (capacity pressure)
- **News mentions**: launching new initiative, entering new market, regulatory change forcing action
- **PR / press**: anything that signals "this company is changing right now"

### Decay signals

- Multiple bankruptcies or PE-stripped operations
- Negative growth + cost-cutting headlines
- Ownership stagnation (small family-owned, no growth incentive)
- Buyer turnover (3+ Marketing Directors in 2 years)

## Discovery Sources (B2B branch)

### Tier 1 - primary discovery

- **Apollo**: best general B2B firmographic + contact discovery
- **ZoomInfo**: enterprise B2B + intent signals (mid-market+)
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: industry + role + signal search; the gold standard for decision-maker mapping (manual)
- **Clay**: when you need custom waterfall lookups (e.g., enrich Apollo records with Hunter, then a waterfall aggregator)

### Tier 2 - industry-specific directories

- **Crunchbase / Pitchbook**: funded businesses
- **D&B Hoovers**: large traditional B2B firmographics
- **State / national business registries**: for verified incorporation data
- **Industry association membership rosters**: trade groups often publish member lists
- **Trade show exhibitor lists**: signals active participation in a vertical
- **Procurement databases** (Procore for construction, e.g.): vertical-specific signals

### Tier 3 - trigger event monitoring

- **Google Alerts / Feedly**: trigger keywords ("acquired," "hires," "expansion," "raises," "announces")
- **PR Newswire / Business Wire**: company-controlled announcements
- **SEC filings** (public companies): material change disclosures
- **State filings**: new entity formation, dissolution

## Top Outreach Targets Selection (B2B)

Prioritize for the top 3-5 hot leads:

1. **Trigger event recency** - 30 days beats 6 months
2. **Trigger event specificity** - new CMO hire in your buyer's role beats "company in the news"
3. **Decision-maker access** - named contact with verified email + LinkedIn beats role-only
4. **Vertical fit precision** - exact NAICS match beats "adjacent industry"

Each top target rationale names the trigger and decision-maker: "Hired new VP of Marketing 14 days ago; verified email; mid-market manufacturer matching ICP."

## Common Mistakes (B2B)

1. **Treating B2B like SaaS** - funding rounds matter less; PE ownership and acquisition activity matter more.
2. **Trying to verify private company revenue precisely** - most public databases approximate. Use size bands, not point estimates.
3. **Ignoring procurement complexity** at enterprise scale - your prospect contact list may not include the actual approver.
4. **Cold-emailing executive assistants** - they're not the buyer and they will flag your outreach as spam.
5. **Source URL hygiene** - without source lineage, you can't defend a contact under GDPR DSAR or CAN-SPAM challenge.
6. **Stopping at one source** - Apollo can be 60% accurate on small businesses. Cross-verify with LinkedIn or the business website.
