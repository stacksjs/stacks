# Wayfinder

Read [the Stacks adaptation rules](../stacks-flow/ENGINEERING.md), then
[PLAYBOOK.md](PLAYBOOK.md). The playbook preserves this workflow's decision
criteria; the Stacks rules govern APIs, tooling, tracking, and authorization.

## Completion

Produce the requested behavior or reviewable artifact and satisfy the
playbook's completion criteria. Preserve existing decisions and user edits.
Use the native Stacks skills for implementation and verification, and carry
existing authorization through the workflow.
