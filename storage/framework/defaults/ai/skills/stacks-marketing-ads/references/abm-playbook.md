# ABM Playbook (Paid)

Account-based marketing with ads: targeting named accounts on LinkedIn and Meta, accelerating open pipeline, and stitching channels together. ABM ads are a *pipeline influence* motion, not a lead-gen motion - measure accordingly.

## When ABM (go/no-go)

Run paid ABM when: target account list ≥ ~1,000 companies (or you accept 1:1/1:few economics), deal size ~$25K+, sales cycle 60+ days, sales and marketing actually aligned on the list, and (for Meta) contact enrichment available.

Skip it when: TAL under ~500 with no enrichment, no first-party data, budget under ~$3K/month, or a short transactional cycle - standard ICP targeting will outperform.

## LinkedIn ABM

Three motions, by list size:

- **1:1** - add the company by name; fully personalized creative for one account.
- **1:few** - up to ~10-20 accounts per campaign, shared pain/industry angle.
- **1:many** - uploaded list (or native targeting), scaled creative.

**List mechanics:**
- LinkedIn needs **300 matched members minimum** to serve; aim for 1,000+ rows (duplicating company names to pad the upload is fine - it dedupes on match). Contact lists match best at scale (LinkedIn suggests ~10K emails); **company lists beat contact lists** for most teams - easier to source, better match rates, less maintenance.
- Cold ABM audiences need ~15K members to deliver reliably.
- **Segment mixed lists.** Left as one audience, LinkedIn over-serves the largest enterprises in the list - accounts have sat at 15% list coverage because the algorithm parked on a few big companies. Split into homogeneous bands (e.g., enterprise / mid-market / SMB) with separate campaigns and budgets.
- List-based targeting typically buys reach materially cheaper than native firmographic targeting, with stronger decision-maker engagement.
- Use the per-company engagement report (Audiences → click into the list) to find under-served priority accounts, then break them into a dedicated campaign.

**Account pages.** For 1:1 and 1:few, send the click to a page built for that account or segment, not the generic homepage. Ways to build them:
- **Personalization layer on the existing site** (Mutiny and similar): swaps headlines and proof by visiting company.
- **CMS template fed from a list** (Webflow, WordPress, or Framer CMS, with Clay, Whalesync, or the CMS API filling one item per account).
- **Hand-coded dynamic route** reading from your CRM or a sheet.
- **AI site platform** (Ploy ◆ documents a Clay row posting to a webhook that runs a Ploybook to publish `/for/<company>`; ◆ marks a [Verified Partner](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills/blob/1efedbc5148b54b2f0f6c6c9fe0be62e151c7fff/tools/REGISTRY.md#verified-partners) of this repository, disclosure not endorsement).

Whichever you use: keep account pages `noindex` and out of the sitemap, use only public or first-party facts about the account, and have a human review before anything publishes.

**Personalized 1:1 creative:** putting the target account's name/logo in the creative can lift CTR ~5-10× over generic ads. **Legal exception: do not run company-name/logo-personalized ads into Germany** - privacy law, not platform policy.

**Frequency capping:** target ~3 impressions/person/week in priority accounts. Mechanic: build a company-engagement audience of accounts that crossed ~500 impressions in the last 7 days and add it as an *exclusion* - it self-rotates accounts out as they cool down. Tune the threshold (300 if fatigue shows, 750 for more pressure).

## ABM on Meta

Meta has no native company targeting - the play is **bring your own matched audience**:

- **The match-rate problem:** raw CRM exports of work emails match under ~5% on Meta. Enrichment providers (identity-graph tools that resolve work identities to personal profiles - e.g., Primer, Metadata, ZoomInfo) raise matches to ~40-85%. Workflow: firmographic criteria → identity-graph match → upload as Custom Audience → target directly or seed a 1% lookalike.
- **Minimum sizes:** account-list audiences ~1,000 companies (5-10K optimal); retargeting slices work down to ~100 accounts; lookalike seeds want 500+.
- Advantage+ **conflicts with strict ABM** - it won't stay locked to your list. Run ABM campaigns manual (or hybrid: manual for the list, Advantage+ for the broad layer).
- Meta's ABM role is cheap **air cover and multi-threading** (reaching the buying committee beyond your champion) while LinkedIn does precision - see the split below.

## Acceleration campaigns (ads against open pipeline)

Ads aimed at accounts already in your pipeline, to speed deals rather than source them:

- Segment the CRM by stage (evaluation / proposal / negotiation), filter to deals worth the spend, upload as an audience, refresh weekly.
- **Use an awareness/reach objective, not conversions** - you're keeping the vendor top-of-mind for the buying committee, not asking in-pipeline accounts to "book a demo" they already booked.
- Creative: case studies, proof, objection-handlers - matched to stage. Budget scales with deal value (larger open deals justify $100-200/day of air cover; stalled deals get a maintenance dose).

## Cross-channel orchestration

Default split for B2B ABM: **~60% LinkedIn / ~30% Meta / ~10% other**. LinkedIn buys precision (right person, right company) at $40-70 CPMs; Meta buys presence and committee reach at $10-25. Sequence LinkedIn first to validate the audience, then extend to Meta. Multi-channel ABM consistently and materially outperforms single-channel on engagement and conversion - the channels compound, they don't compete.

## Cross-channel UTM remarketing

The cheapest high-quality audience you can build: retarget one platform's validated clickers on another platform.

1. Tag all paid traffic with consistent UTMs (`utm_source=linkedin`, `utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc`).
2. On Meta, build a website Custom Audience with the rule **"URL contains `utm_source=linkedin`"** (or `utm_source=google`).
3. Retarget that audience on Meta - LinkedIn-grade audience quality at Meta-grade CPMs (typically 50-70% cheaper reach).

Works in both directions (search clickers → LinkedIn remarketing needs meaningful search volume - worth it above roughly $30K/month search spend). Requires enough source-channel traffic to clear minimum audience sizes. Use a consistent account/campaign token in UTMs so attribution survives the hop.

## Sales orchestration

ABM ads without sales follow-up is billboard spend:

- Pipe ad-engagement signals to the CRM (LinkedIn company-engagement exports, or connectors that sync engagement per account) and treat an engagement spike as a sales trigger - **outreach within ~48 hours** of the spike.
- Route new leads to a shared channel (Slack webhook) with a per-campaign quality reaction (👍/👎) - the cheapest lead-quality feedback loop that exists.
- Hold a monthly sales-marketing session on the list itself: who's engaging, who's dark, who closed - and re-cut the list.
- Expect ~7-10 cross-channel touches before a sales conversation is normal at ABM deal sizes.

## Measuring ABM

Judge ABM on account movement, not CPL:

- **Account penetration** (% of list reached): target ~40-60%.
- **Cost per engaged account** (not per click): ~$100-300 is a workable band.
- **Account → opportunity rate:** ~10-20%.
- **Pipeline influenced:** aim for 3-5× spend; expect win-rate and velocity improvements on engaged vs. non-engaged accounts.
- **Incrementality:** hold out ~20% of the list from ads and compare pipeline formation after 21+ days - the only honest answer to "did the ads do anything?"
