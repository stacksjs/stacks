# Meta Decision System (B2B)

A quantified kill/keep/scale engine for Meta ads. Every threshold derives from one anchor number, so decisions become arithmetic instead of vibes. Pairs with the strategy-level Meta playbook in SKILL.md (creative-as-targeting, creative volume) - this file is the *operating* layer.

## TCPL: the anchor variable

TCPL = **Target Cost Per Qualified Lead** (qualified = meets your ICP bar, not just a form-fill). Set it one of three ways:

1. **From deal math (best):** TCPL = target cost per demo × qualified-lead-to-demo rate. ($2,000/demo × 0.28 = $560.)
2. **From history:** TCPL = trailing 30-day CPL(qualified) × 0.80 - a 20% improvement is achievable through operational cleanup alone (killing zero-QL ads, graduating winners). Once you have both, use whichever is tighter.
3. **New account:** target CAC × qualified-lead-to-customer rate, or a placeholder from your ACV tier; replace with method 2 after 30 days.

Every rule below is expressed in multiples of TCPL. Review TCPL monthly.

## The ad-count ceiling

More active ads than your budget can feed = every ad starves and nothing gets a fair read.

**Ceiling = (daily budget × 14) / (2 × TCPL)** - i.e., over a 14-day evaluation window, each ad needs at least 2× TCPL of spend to be judged.

$1,000/day at $500 TCPL → ceiling of 14 ads; run **6-10** (winners + 2-3 test slots). At the ceiling, launching a new test requires killing something first.

## Two-campaign structure (Scaling / Testing)

Run two CBO campaigns over the **same audience**:

- **Scaling campaign (~80% of budget)** - holds only graduated, proven ads.
- **Testing campaign (~20%)** - holds new concepts and iterations, with its own protected budget.

Why: inside a single CBO, proven ads always starve new ads - tests never get enough spend to be judged. Why not ABO for testing: equal forced distribution keeps spending on ads Meta has already deprioritized. The separation is *budget protection*, not audience segmentation.

**Image-first validation:** launch new concepts as statics first; only produce the video/carousel/UGC version after the image passes the checks below. Exception: concepts that are inherently video (testimonial, demo, UGC).

## Destination testing (CBO per persona, one ad set per destination)

A complementary structure for when the **lander, not the creative, is the biggest unknown**: one CBO per persona; inside it, one ad set per destination type - PDP, listicle/advertorial, quiz, demo page - with the **same creatives in every ad set**. Holding creative constant makes the read clean: any CPM or performance divergence between ad sets is the destination.

Why it works: the destination is a test axis of the same rank as creative - a losing funnel can hide winning creative, and different personas convert through different funnel shapes. CBO allocates budget across destinations the way it allocates across ads, and practitioners running this report wide CPM/performance spreads between destinations plus meaningful new-reach gains (~30%) from the added variety.

Fit with the two-campaign structure: treat a destination test like a concept test - run it in the Testing campaign with a protected budget, judge each ad set against TCPL at the usual spend gates, then graduate the winning creative × destination pair. *Practitioner-reported pattern (Alexander Pauwelyn, 2026), not a platform-documented mechanic - validate against your own account data.*

## Stage 1: delivery check (day 7)

CBO's spend allocation is itself a signal - Meta pre-screens your ads. At day 7 for each test ad:

- **Fair share test:** minimum expected spend = (campaign daily budget ÷ active ads) × 7 × 0.5. Below that → **kill** (Meta actively deprioritized it). Zero spend → kill immediately.
- **Ongoing:** if an ad has spent ≥ 1× TCPL lifetime AND averaged under ~$10/day over the last 7 days → kill. (The lifetime-spend gate stops you from killing ads CBO simply hasn't explored yet.)

When iterating on a delivery-killed ad, change the **hook/visual/format only** - the audience never got far enough for copy or CTA to matter.

## Stage 2: quality evaluation (weekly, rolling 14-day data)

Run in order; stop at the first triggered action:

1. **Data gate:** spend < 3× TCPL → **wait** (not enough signal). At true cost-per-QL = target, 3× TCPL of spend should produce ~3 qualified leads; zero QLs at that spend is ~5% probability - so judging at 3× gives ~95% confidence without wasting budget (2× has a 13% false-negative rate; 5× overpays for certainty).
2. **Zero pixel leads** at ≥3× TCPL → **swap and abandon the concept** (don't iterate a dead concept).
3. **Quality check** (the layer Meta can't see - requires your CRM):
   - Pixel leads but zero qualified → swap; keep the format, change the angle.
   - Qualified rate <40% → swap; the ad attracts the wrong people. Add ICP-filtering language. (At 40% QL rate, true cost per QL is 2.5× the pixel CPL you see in Ads Manager - two ads identical in-platform can differ 60%+ in real cost.)
   - 40-60% → monitor one more week. ≥60% → proceed.
4. **Cost check:** cost per QL ≤ TCPL → candidate winner. 1-1.5× TCPL → monitor (normal variance). >1.5× TCPL → swap (structural underperformance, not noise).

## Graduation criteria (Testing → Scaling)

Graduate only when **all** are true: ≥5 qualified leads · qualified rate ≥60% · cost per QL ≤ TCPL · running ≥14 days · ≥1 QL in the last 7 days.

## Fatigue detection

Frequency bands by campaign type (safe / warning / critical):

| Campaign type | Safe | Warning | Critical |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold prospecting | 1.0-2.5 | 2.5-4.0 | >4.0 |
| Retargeting | 2.0-4.0 | 4.0-6.0 | >6.0 |
| ABM (small audiences) | 2.0-5.0 | 5.0-8.0 | >8.0 |

Other signals, in urgency order: CTR down 20%+ from baseline over 7 days; CPM up 30%+ over 2 weeks (leading indicator - moves before CTR); ad relevance rankings "below average"; CPA up with stable targeting.

For **scaling-campaign ads**, apply a deliberately stricter bar than the general bands - these ads carry ~80% of spend, so fatigue there costs the most: warning at frequency 3.0-3.5 or cost +20% → start 2 iterations now (they take ~14 days to be ready); swap at >3.5, cost +40%, or >1.5× TCPL for 2 weeks.

**Lifespan expectations (B2B):** statics 14-28 days; short video and carousels 21-35; UGC/testimonial 28-42. Small B2B audiences build frequency fast - plan refresh every 14-21 days.

**Retire (don't iterate)** when CTR drops 30%+ from peak or frequency crosses the campaign type's critical band above - the concept is exhausted, not the execution.

**Rotation without resetting learning:** never edit creative inside a performing ad - that resets the learning phase. Launch new ads alongside existing ones, or spin up a new ad set with the same targeting. Pausing doesn't reset; editing does.

## Swap rules

**Never pause without a replacement.** Keep 2-3 iterations staged; replacement live within 7 days, immediately for critical fatigue. If the pipeline is empty, redirect the budget to proven ads rather than leaving a zombie running. What to change depends on why it died: delivery kill → hook/visual; quality kill → angle and ICP language; cost kill → offer and audience; fatigue → fresh execution of the same proven concept.

## Creative production math

- **Test throughput** ≈ (monthly budget × 0.20) ÷ (3 × TCPL), per month. Delivery kills free budget early, so actual throughput runs ~1.5-2× the base rate.
- **Win rates:** iterations on winners ~25%; brand-new concepts ~10%; blended ~1 in 6. To get N winners, plan ~6× N tests.
- **Minimum proven-ad inventory** ≈ monthly budget ÷ $5,000 - each proven B2B ad absorbs roughly $5K/month before fatiguing. **You cannot scale budget ahead of creative supply**; if proven ads < minimum, fix the creative deficit before raising budget.
- **Iteration priority** when refreshing a winner (ranked by impact): 1. hook (changes who stops) → 2. visual treatment → 3. format → 4. body copy/CTA.

## Scaling protocol

Scale only when all: proven-ad count meets the next budget level's minimum; account frequency <3.0; cost per QL ≤ TCPL for 2+ consecutive weeks; 3+ replacements staged.

- **Rate:** +20% every 5 days. Never +30% or more in one move - that resets learning.
- **Rollback trigger:** cost per QL >1.5× TCPL after a scale step → cut budget 20-30% immediately, stabilize 2 weeks, resume at +10% per week.
- **Hitting the wall** (account-wide average frequency >3.5 - an account-level *scale* guardrail, distinct from the per-ad fatigue bands above): expand lookalikes 1% → 2-3%, add new seed audiences, test broad, activate cross-channel UTM audiences (see [ABM playbook](abm-playbook.md)), re-open remarketing.

## Weekly cadence

- **Monday - decision day:** pull rolling 14-day data; run Stage 2 on every test ad; run the fatigue check on every scaling ad.
- **Wednesday - launch day:** launch new tests into freed slots; run Stage 1 on ads that hit day 7.
- **Friday - scaling day:** apply scale steps or rollbacks.
- **Monthly:** creative library audit + TCPL review.

## Lead forms and social amnesia

The #1 B2B Meta lead-quality problem: frictionless auto-filled forms produce leads who don't remember converting ("social amnesia"). **Intentional friction = awareness = quality:**

- Use **Higher Intent** form type (adds a review step), not More Volume.
- **Require work email** - it can't auto-fill from the Facebook profile, forcing a conscious act. This is the single biggest quality lever.
- Add 1-3 multiple-choice qualification questions (4+ spikes abandonment), ordered easiest → hardest.
- Confirmation message sets expectations for what happens next (combats amnesia at the follow-up stage).

Lead form vs. landing page: LP converting ≥5% → use the LP; LP under ~2% → lead form; demo/trial offers → LP; content/webinar → form.

## Advantage+ transition

Manual is where you learn; Advantage+ is where you earn. Transition a campaign to Advantage+ only after: a proven offer, a validated audience, and **~50 conversions/week** on the optimization event (the learning-phase exit bar - budget needed ≈ target CPA × 50 ÷ 7 per day). If you can't hit 50/week on the target event, optimize a higher-volume event up-funnel and retarget converters. Advantage+ conflicts with strict ABM (you can't lock it to a list) - see the [ABM playbook](abm-playbook.md). Watch Campaign Score directionally (70+ healthy, <50 = fighting the algorithm) but never trade lead quality for score.

## Partnership ads (the net-new-reach lever)

Everything above optimizes *conversion inside an audience Meta already reaches you*. Partnership ads are how you reach a **net-new** one. Andromeda targets by **persona**, not interest lists - and a creator's own following *is* a pre-assembled persona. Running an ad as a partnership (branded content from the creator's handle) inherits that seed audience, so the algorithm expands from people who already trust the fronting creator. This is the single highest-leverage lever on Meta right now; a serious account without partnership ads is bringing a butter knife to a gunfight.

**Where it fits the decision system:** partnership ads are a *scaling* move, not a testing gimmick. When the account hits the wall (frequency >3.5, rolling reach flattening - see below), the "add new seed audiences" step in the [scaling protocol](#scaling-protocol) is largely *this*. Judge them against TCPL like any other ad, but expect a different failure mode: a weak partnership ad is usually the wrong *creator*, not the wrong hook.

**Partnership-ads playbook:**

1. **Pre-test before you promote.** Don't pay to boost a creator's post on faith. Let their content run organically (or in a cheap traffic/engagement test) first; promote only the pieces that already earn saves, shares, and watch-through. Paid spend amplifies what's working - it doesn't rescue a flat creator.
2. **Pick for persona overlap, not follower count.** The seed audience only helps if the creator's followers *are* your ICP. A 15K-follower creator whose audience is exactly your buyer beats a 500K generalist. Vet the audience, not the vanity metric.
3. **Deal structure basics:** get **whitelisting / branded-content-partner access** (run ads *from the creator's handle*, not just reposts - this is what unlocks the seed audience) with **usage rights** for a defined window (typically 3-6 months, renewable) plus **spend/paid-amplification rights**. Pay a flat content fee; add per-deliverable pricing for extra cuts. Avoid pure revenue-share on cold creators - you can't attribute cleanly yet.
4. **Companion tactic - commission low-fi statics per creator.** When you contract a creator for the partnership video, *also* commission a few quick, low-fi statics (screenshot-style, "how they'd post it to their own story"). Each creator then becomes a **mini-funnel**: the partnership video punctures cold net-new reach, the low-fi statics support mid-funnel conversion under the same trusted face. Cheap to add, and it multiplies the return on the creator relationship.

Format-level guidance on *which* creator-fronted formats to run (founder content, yapper, authority, amateur-investigation, creator low-fi statics, etc.) lives in the ad-creative format taxonomy: [meta-creative-formats.md](../../stacks-marketing-ad-creative/references/meta-creative-formats.md) *(sibling addition - forward link)*.

## Rolling reach as a health signal

Rolling **month-over-month reach** (unique people reached, MoM) is the account's net-new-audience gauge - the thing conversion metrics can't tell you. CPL and ROAS can look fine while you quietly recycle the same shrinking pool; the tell is reach going flat or declining month over month even as spend holds.

- **Track it monthly** alongside the TCPL review. Falling rolling reach is a *leading* indicator of the frequency wall (it moves before frequency crosses 3.5 and before CPMs spike).
- **Trigger:** rolling reach declining MoM → **deploy partnership ads** to restore net-new reach (new seed audiences), before the fatigue bands force your hand. Treat it as the same class of guardrail as the frequency ceiling in the [scaling protocol](#scaling-protocol) - an account-level scale signal, not a per-ad fatigue read.

## Benchmarks and seasonality

B2B SaaS Meta ranges (practitioner-reported; recalibrate on your own first 30 days): CTR 1.0-1.5% (red flag <0.8%); CPM $10-20 (red flag >$25); CPL (form) $20-50 (red flag >$75); landing page CVR 8-12%. Seasonality: Q1 CPMs are the year's lowest (scale aggressively); Q4 runs +60-80% (consider reducing B2B spend and banking budget for January).
