# Bootcamp

This bootcamp is a collection of tutorials, guides, and resources to help you get started with Stacks. Read along to learn about the features that make up the core Stacks logic.

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace, using our thorough documentation covering every aspect of the framework. Stacks is extremely beginner & expert-friendly.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript—that's all you need to dive in now! _Or TypeScript ✌🏼_

Continue with this bootcamp to learn about the above.

<!-- ## Features

The Stacks framework is a harmony of several “engines”, designed to build any web and/or desktop application—in highly scalable & privacy-friendly ways. It consists of the following engines:

### Stacks UI

_Develop dynamic UIs with helpers for atomic design, and much more._

- 🧩 **Components** _a primitive to develop user interfaces_
- 🤖 **Functions** _a primitive to develop business logic (and grant your UI superpowers)_
- 🌐 **Web** _"a routing & templating engine that makes sense" using components—SSG & PWA ready_
- 🖥️ **Desktop** _automagically build a desktop app out of your web app_
- 📚 **Library** _auto-builds component & function libraries_
- ⚡️ Powered by Bun, Nitro, Tauri, UnoCSS, Vite & Vue

### Stacks Functions

_Develop serverless (or server) functions with countless helpers to build scalable & fast APIs._

- 🪄 **AI** _deep AI integration_
- 🤖 **APIs** _scalability & maintainability built-in_
- 🏎️ **Cache** _Redis, DynamoDB, Upstash, SingleStore, and more—serverless_
- ⚙️ **CLIs** _create beautiful CLIs for Linux, Windows, and Mac—without requirements_
- 📀 **Database** _MySQL, Postgres, PlanetScale, Supabase, Prisma, ..._
- 👾 **Errors** _native type-safe error handling_
- 🗓️ **Events** _functional event (front & backend) communication_
- 📢 **Notifications** _emails, SMSs, direct, and push notifications & webhooks_
- 🗺️ **ORM** _supercharged, fully-typed models & relations (including automated migrations)_
- 💳 **Payments** _unified API for one-off & subscription billing methods for Stripe_
- ⚙️ **Queues** _run any heavy workload in the background_
- 🛠️ **Query Builder** _powerful, type-safe SQL query builder_
- 💬 **Realtime** _“everything you need to build dynamic real-time apps”_
- 🧭 **Router** _smart routing, file-based or Laravel-like_
- 🔎 **Search Engine** _smart searching, advanced filtering & sorting, pagination, headless UI_
- 💾 **Storage** _easily create & make use of local & remote storages/file systems_
- 🧪 **Tinker** _a powerful TypeScript REPL_
- 🌪️ **Validation** _e2e type-safety (true frontend & backend harmony)_
- 🎯 **X-Ray** _all you need to debug, log & analyze_

### Stacks Cloud

_Create your personal or professional Vercel-like cloud, based on MIT-licensed OSS._

- ☁️ **Server** _local development server & production-ready servers_
- ⛅️ **Serverless** _on-demand, auto-scaling, zero maintenance_
- 🚏 **CDN** _zero-config low-latency CDN, including request life-cycle hooks & optimized request compressions (Brotli & gzip)_
- 🔀 **Domain** _version-controlled & zero-config domain management (e.g. DNS management)_
- 📧 **Email** _secure & simplistic <easy-peasy@custom-domains.com> mail_
- 🔐 **Firewall** _native web application firewall support_
- 🚜 **Maintenance** _maintain your cloud infrastructure with ease using Buddy & Stacks_
- 🤖 **Infrastructure as Code** _version-controlled cloud infrastructure_

### Stacks CI/CD

_Focus on coding, not publishing._

- 🚀 **Deployment Manager** _take the sweat out of production deployments (AWS, Vercel, Netlify, and more)_
- 📫 **Release Manager** _libraries (component & function) auto-published to npm, git helpers, and more_

### Stacks DX

_Enhanced productivity for developers. No more creating boilerplate._

- 💡 **IDE Integration** _auto-completions, inline docs & a powerful VS Code setup_
- 🪄 **Zero-Config** _yet highly configurable—convention over configuration_
- 👩🏽‍🔧 **Linter & Formatter** _auto-configured & built into your IDE_
- 💪🏼 **Type Strong** _built-in e2e type-safety_
- ✨ **Git Workflows** _committing with ease_
- 🚗 **Auto Imports** _your components & functions, including date, string, array, & object helpers_
- ⏩ **Code Snippets** _say goodbye to the boilerplate—thank you Sarah Drasner_
- 🔤 **Spell Checker** _be notified once there are typos_
- 🛠️ **Utilities** _Collections, VueUse, and more_
- 🧪 **Testing** _unit & e2e tests powered by Bun & Playwright_ -->
