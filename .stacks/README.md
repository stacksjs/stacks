# @ow3/stacks

This package contains the "core" logic of the framework/the monorepo setup, e.g. the build logic (excluding the VS Code/IDE setup).

## ☘️ Features

The ultimate goal of this framework, Stacks, is to _help you_ create a component library. Stacks is a toolkit of composables, methods, and other goodies required to build optimized component libraries. A highly optimized build process that automatically generates `.mjs` & `.cjs` library distributions for you, including its types.

Other included core features are:

- ⚡️ Vite & unbuild plugins to build the component library
- 🏎 Blazing fast, empowered by a beautiful DX
- 👣 Tiny foot-print in production builds
- 💬 Fully-typed TypeScript definitions
- 🌳 Treeshaking for Vue & Web Components
- 🎨 Optimized UnoCSS build for Vue & Web Components _(defaults to Tailwind CSS utility classes)_
- 🧙🏼‍♀️ Unified way to access hundreds of [icon sets](https://icon-sets.iconify.design)
 — [Icons in Pure CSS](https://antfu.me/posts/icons-in-pure-css)

And all of this in a zero-config, yet configurable, way.

## 🤖 Usage

If you want to use Stacks outside of this framework, install it as a dev dependency:

```bash
pnpm i -D @ow3/stacks # wip
```

Now, you can use it in your project:

```js
import {
  alias,
  buildVueComponents,
  buildWebComponents,
  buildFunctions,
  buildStacks,
  defineConfig,
  resolve,
  Stacks,
  UserConfig,
 } from '@ow3/stacks'

 // you are now free to use any of the imported methods
```
