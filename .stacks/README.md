# Rapid Application Development

Develop modern framework-agnostic web apps & libraries, faster. Stacks.js is a progressive full-stack framework with an approachable & easy-to-use onboarding experience.

## ☘️ Features

The goal of the framework is to _help you_ build applications rapidly & more efficiently, removing the boilerplate wherever possible—and the learning curve! Whether it's APIs, a component and/or function library, or simply a statically generate site, Stacks is a toolkit of composables, methods, and other goodies, required to build optimized outputs.

In other words, it's a highly optimized build process that automatically generates:

- `.mjs` & `.cjs` library distributions, including its TypeScript types
- a highly-performant JavaScript production-ready server to be deployed anywhere (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc.)

Other included core features are:

- ⚡️ Vite powered, optimized for speed
- 🚜 Create one component, automatically generate a Vue & Web Component library
- 🎨 Optimized CSS engine for Vue & Web Components, and SSG pages _(defaults to Tailwind CSS utility classes)_
- 👣 Headless framework
- 🌳 Treeshaking for Vue & Web Components, and function libraries
- 💬 Fully-typed TypeScript definitions
- 📰 Automatically publishes your libraries to npm & creates your changelogs
- 🧙🏼‍♀️ Unified way to access hundreds of [icon sets](https://icon-sets.iconify.design)
 — [Icons in Pure CSS](https://antfu.me/posts/icons-in-pure-css)

And all of this in a zero-config, yet highly-configurable, way.

## 🤖 Usage

If you want to use Stacks outside of this framework, install it as a dev dependency:

```bash
pnpm i -D stacks
```

Now, you can use it in your project:

```ts
import * as stacks from 'stacks'
```

You may easily import any of the exported methods. Learn more in the docs.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```
