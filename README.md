# The Modern Component Library

The Stacks Framework helps kick-start & maintain development of your next component library. Stacks is the most simple & comfortable solution for frontend developers to build highly-modular, widely-accepted & scalable component libraries. No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, Stacks' approachable design allows you to learn more about its capabilities as you develop your library.

> _The clever way to build component libraries._

Develop beautiful reactive composable UIs without learning a new language. HTML, CSS, sprinkled with minimal JavaScript—dive in now!

## ☘️ Features

The ultimate goal of this framework, Stacks, is to _help you_ create a component library. Stacks is a highly optimized build process that automatically generates `.mjs` & `.cjs` library distributions for you, including its types. Other core features include:

- Automagically builds & distributes Web Component & Vue (2 & 3) libraries for you
- Zero-config by default, yet highly-configurable—if needed
- Delightful Developer Experience _(DX)_
- Style with ease via UnoCSS _(e.g. Tailwind CSS, Windi CSS, Heroicons, Bootstrap, etc.)_
- Modern git commit conventions
- Automated npm package releases & semver versioning
- Pretty changelog generations _(markdown & GitHub releases)_
- Fully-typed, automatically _(your components & composables)_
- Optimized & automated GitHub PR dependency updates
- Bootstrapped documentation tooling & site to present library _(via VitePress)_
- Pre-configured Playground & Examples

## 💡 Get Started

It's easy incredibly easy to get started. The only prerequisite is a basic understanding of how to work with basic HTML & JavaScript. with Vue Single File Components (SFCs). In other words, there is virtually no learning curve because "HTML with sprinkled JavaScript" will get you _incredibly_ far.

```bash
# you may "Use this template" via the button in top right corner of this page
# or run the following commands:
npx degit openwebstacks/stacks-framework hello-world-stack
cd hello-world-stack
npm run setup # WIP
```

## 🤖 Usage

The following is a list of some of the most common ways to use interact with Stacks:

```bash
pnpm install # install all dependencies (for all packages/workspaces)
pnpm fresh # fresh reinstall of all dependencies

pnpm dev # stubs the libraries for local use
pnpm example # run one of the examples (follow CLI prompts)

pnpm build # builds a specific package (follow CLI prompts)
pnpm build:all # builds the library for production-ready use

pnpm commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
pnpm release # releases the library (packages) to npm

pnpm docs:dev # starts local server for the documentation site
pnpm docs:build # builds the documentation site
pnpm docs:serve # serves the documentation site
```

_The `package.json` may contain additional useful snippets you want to be aware of._

Because we optimize toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, our primary intention is always _keep it simple, yet configurable_:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="hello-world-elements.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Optionally, if you prefer using Vue:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world-vue'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

Read more about the setup & tips in the docs.

### Developer Experience (DX)

Stacks is a Component-First, UI & Build Framework. When developing your own library, Stacks bootstraps the following for you:

- [Powerful Build Engine](https://github.com/openwebstacks/stacks-framework/tree/main/.stacks/builds) - Stacks is a optimized [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) & [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) harmony
- [Modern CSS Engine](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) - pre-configured UnoCSS allows to create & manage your style guide with ease
- [Fully Typed APIs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - via TypeScript 4.7
- [Be a Good Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-cz) - pre-configured Commitizen & git-cz setup to simplify semantic git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
- [Built With Testing In Mind](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) - pre-configured unit-testing powered by [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) & e2e-testing by [Cypress](https://cypress.io/)
- [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) - optimized & automated PR dependency updates
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - runs your CI (fixes code style issues, tags releases & creates its changelogs, runs the test suite, etc.
