Stacks is a rapid development framework, where the goal is to _help you_ create & maintain frontends, backends, and clouds—without having to worry about the boilerplate. _An all-in-one toolkit that meets all your full stack needs._

- Web & Desktop Applications _(including system tray apps)_
- Serverless & Traditional APIs
- Cloud Infrastructure Creation & Maintenance
- Interactive CLIs
- Framework-agnostic Component & Function Libraries
- Deployment & Release Manager _(CI & CD)_

## Convention Over Configuration

As a developer, Stacks helps you every step along the way—in beginner & expert-friendly ways, allowing you to focus on the _what & why_ of your project, all while enabling you to stay in control & ownership of your _(& your users’)_ data.

> “It is the framework’s responsibility to remove patterns that lead to boilerplate code. And Stacks is really good at that.” _- Chris_

<!-- ![Atomic UI & FX Design](./docs/assets/diagram.png) -->

## Get Started

It’s incredibly easy to get started with this framework. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -Ssf stacksjs.org/install | sh # wip

# alternatively, if Bun >= v1.2.14 is installed already,
# you may also get started via:
bunx buddy new my-project
```

## Usage

The following list includes some of the most common ways to interact with the Stacks API.

_Meet the toolkit, Buddy:_

```bash
buddy install # installs all dependencies
buddy dev # starts one of the dev servers (frontend, API, components, docs, desktop, etc.)
buddy share # creates a sharable link of your local project
buddy build # follow CLI prompts to select which library (or server) to build
buddy commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
buddy release # creates the releases for the stack & consequently, publishes them to npm
buddy upgrade # auto-update all deps & the Stacks framework

buddy make:component HelloWorld # scaffolds a Component
buddy make:function HelloWorld # scaffolds a Function
buddy make:model Car # scaffolds a Model
buddy make:action UpdateCar # scaffolds an Action

## Features

The Stacks framework is a harmony of several “engines” to build any web and/or desktop application, in highly scalable & privacy-friendly ways. It consists of the following engines:

### Frontend Development

_Develop dynamic UIs with helpers for atomic design, and much more._

- 🧩 **Components** _primitive to develop user interfaces_
- 🤖 **Functions** _primitive to develop business logic (and grant your UI superpowers)_
- 🎨 **UI Kit** _modern & deeply-integrated components_
- 🌐 **Web** _“a routing & templating engine that makes sense”_
- 🖥️ **Desktop** _transforms your web app into a desktop app, plus more_
- 📝 **Documentation** _markdown-based documentation, auto-generated_
- 📚 **Library** _auto-builds & manages component & function libraries_
- ⚡️ Powered by Bun, Tauri, UnoCSS, Vite, VitePress and Vue

### Backend Development

_Develop serverless (or server) functions with countless helpers to build scalable & fast APIs._

- 🪄 **AI** _deep AI integrations to simplify building agentic workflow_
- 🤖 **APIs** _scalability & maintainability built-in_

- ⚙️ **Queues** _run any heavy workload in the background_
- 🛠️ **Query Builder** _powerful, type-safe SQL query builder_
- 💬 **Realtime** _“everything you need to build dynamic real-time apps”_
- 🧭 **Router** _smart routing, file-based or Laravel-like_
- 🔎 **Search Engine** _smart searching, advanced filtering & sorting, pagination, headless UI_
- 💾 **Storage** _a secure-by-default File API that feels right_
- 🧪 **Tinker** _a powerful TypeScript REPL_
- 🌪️ **Validation** _e2e type-safety (true frontend & backend harmony)_
- 🎯 **X-Ray** _all you need to debug, log & analyze_

### Cloud Development

_Develop & maintain cloud infrastructure with ease. “Imagine Vercel, Vapor and Forge having been unified.”_

- ☁️ **Server** _local development server & production-ready servers out-of-the-box_
- ⛅️ **Serverless** _on-demand, auto-scaling, zero maintenance_
- ⏰ **Alarms** _built-in cloud infrastructure monitoring to avoid surprises_
- 🚏 **CDN** _zero-config, low-latency, request life-cycle hooks, optimized request compressions (Brotli & gzip)_
- 🔀 **Domain** _version-controlled & zero-config domain management (e.g. DNS management)_
- 🤖 **AI** _fine-tune a foundational model using your application data_
- 📧 **Email** _secure & zero-setup <easy-peasy@custom-domains.com> mailboxes_
- 🔐 **Firewall** _native web application firewall support_
- 📦 **Storage** _unlimited cloud storage & automatic backups_
- 🚜 **Maintenance** _maintain your cloud infrastructure with ease using Buddy & Stacks_
- 🚦 **Infrastructure as Code** _version-controlled cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google next?)_

### CI/CD

_Focus on coding, not publishing._

- 🚀 **Deployment Manager** _takes the sweat out of production deployments—zero-setup push-to-deploy_
- 0️⃣ **Zero Downtime** _deploy with confidence using a zero-downtime deployment strategy_
- 📫 **Release Manager** _libraries (component & function) auto-published to npm, git helpers, and more_

### Developer Experience (DX)

Convention over configuration, while staying wholly configurable. _No more boilerplate._

- 💎 **Automated Upgrades** _no need to worry about upgrading to the latest versions, Stacks upgrades you_
- 🦋 **Pretty Dev URLs** _your-project.localhost instead of localhost:3000_
- 💡 **IDE Integration** _auto-completions, inline docs & a powerful IDE setup_
- 🪄 **Zero-Config** _yet highly configurable—convention over configuration_
- 💅 **Linter & Formatter** _auto-configured & built into your IDE_
- 💪🏼 **Type Strong** _built-in e2e type-safety_
- ✨ **Git Workflows** _committing with ease_
- 🚗 **Auto Imports** _your components & functions, including date, string, array, & object helpers_
- ⏩ **Code Snippets** _goodbye to the boilerplate code—thank you Sarah Drasner_
- 🔤 **Spell Checker** _be notified once there are typos_
- 🛠️ **Essential Utilities** _powers at your fingertips. Collections, VueUse, and more_
- 👥 **Team Management** _manage your team & their permissions_
- 🧪 **Streamlined Testing** _unit & e2e tests powered by Bun, Vitest & Playwright_

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace, using our thorough documentation covering every aspect of the framework. Stacks is extremely beginner & expert-friendly.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript—that’s all you need to dive in now! _Or TypeScript ✌🏼_

> _An actual rapid application development framework for all Full Stack needs. Next-level simplicity & DX._
