# The Modern Component Library

The ultimate goal of the Stacks Framework is to _help you_ create & maintain component & function libraries. It is the most simple & comfortable solution for developers to build highly-modular, widely-accepted & scalable libraries, in a beginner-friendly way.

> _The clever way to build component & function libraries._

**🤖 Zero-config by default**  

The highly optimized Stacks bundler automagically builds & distributes CommonJS & module library formats. Stacks also automatically generates a Web Component library, Vue 2 & 3 libraries, a composables/functions library, plus all of its relating component & composable type declarations.

**🎨 Style with ease**

Create your own style guide using conventions you are familiar with via UnoCSS. _(e.g. Tailwind CSS, Windi CSS, Heroicons, Bootstrap, etc.)_

**⚡️ Next-Gen Developer Experience _(DX)_**

Whether it is the simple setup, modern git commit conventions via commitlint, a modern CI, automated npm package releases & semver versioning, pretty changelog generations, GitHub PR dependency updates, spell-checking, integrated documentation tooling, or a pre-configured playground & examples. _Stacks has it all._

**💡 Delightful VS Code integration**

IDE Capabilities, such as type hints, code completion, code formatting, and more, are all natively built-in within Stacks. _Without the need of Prettier._

**🧙🏼‍♀️ Extremely beginner & expert-friendly**

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs & functions without learning a new language. HTML, CSS, sprinkled with minimal JavaScript—that's all you need to dive in now!

## Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get started with this framework:

```bash
# you may "Use this template" via the button in top right corner of this page
# or run the following commands:
npx degit openwebstacks/stacks-framework hello-world-stack
cd hello-world-stack
npx artisan setup # WIP
```

## 🤖 Usage

The following is a list of some of the most common ways to use interact with Stacks:

```bash
pnpm install # installs deps for all workspaces
pnpm fresh # fresh reinstall of all deps

pnpm dev # stubs the libraries for local use
pnpm example # run one of the examples (follow CLI prompts)

pnpm build # builds a specific package (follow CLI prompts)
pnpm build:all # builds the library for production-ready use

pnpm commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
pnpm release # releases the library (packages) to npm

pnpm docs:dev # starts local server for the documentation site
pnpm docs:build # builds the documentation site
pnpm docs:serve # serves the documentation site
```

_The `package.json` contains additional useful snippets you may want to be aware of._

Because we optimize toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, our primary intention is to always _keep it simple, yet configurable_:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="hello-world-elements.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Optionally, if you prefer using Vue:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world-vue'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

When using this framework, feel free to adjust it to your needs. It is "simply" a set of rules to help you quickly & efficiently bootstrap & design component libraries, using industry best-practices.

## 🧪 Testing

pnpm test
```
